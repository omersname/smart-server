The recipient of my call says they answer the call and it’s just static. Now, if I place the call manually either through my phone or by pressing the buttons on my radio, it goes through just fine. But using the dictation feature through the steering wheel causes a glitch I guess? It just won’t come through the speakers. I have reset my car infotainment system to factory, I have reset all CarPlay settings on my phone. Nothing works so far. The problem is the update. My phone/CarPlay has functioned through all the updates until the 15 version. I can receive calls. I can make calls manually but I can’t use the button on the steering wheel to make a call. Now that defeats the purpose of handsfree doesn’t it? Something was changed during the update or something caused a glitch. Anyone else having this issue? ",

It will later randomly start playing again whenever it feels like it with the app closed, and I have to open it, and close it once again. This is obviously a huge issue because people have been posting videos and “fixes” on the web, but none of these things are solutions. Why is this so hard? Besides the fact that it should not do this to begin with (if I want to play music, I will!) There should just be a button or something to tap to turn this incredibly annoying “feature” OFF! Not some trickery deep in settings that have nothing to do with iTunes that don’t work anyway. I have an old aftermarket stereo that does not have car play or anything like that, just Bluetooth audio. 5S never did this. What is going on here? It’s making me insane! Please help!",

The software had been trouble free for me until I had to move back to India.\nMy carrier in India is Airtel which has good LTE coverage in my hometown. It supports VoLTE and WiFi calling as well. Since I moved to India, VoLTE or WiFi calling is not working for me. I rolled back to One UI 3.1 using Smart Switch and VoLTE and WiFi calling started working again. But, since I was already enrolled into One UI 4 beta, I got upgraded to the beta version again and VoLTE and WiFi calling stopped working. Interestingly, I used my Mint mobile sim card which I used in US and VoLTE and WiFi calling work with this card.\nI contacted @USBetaModerator and he deregistered me from One UI 4 beta. I was able to downgrade to OneUI 3.1 again using Smart Switch. I was so relieved seeing VoLTE and WiFi calling working again.\nToday, One UI 4 stable version was rolled out. I upgraded to this G998U1UEU4BUK7 version. To my frustration, VoLTE and WiFi calling stopped working again. This means that anyone who has a Samsung S21 series phone (or maybe any Samsung phone) with OneUI 4 will have the same problem. You won't be able to use it outside US.\nI am assuming the network auto switch feature which Samsung introduced with One UI 4 is causing this issue. I had been trying to get some help from the Samsung team, but none has been able to help so far.\n@sr14 is another user who is facing the exact same issue. \n@USBetaModerator @Samsungteam If you have a solution for this issue, let us know. Or at least advise the customers who plan to use their phones outside US not to upgrade to One UI 4.\nAttaching the screenshots for everyone's reference. As you can see, in One UI 4, \"IMS Registration\" status is shown as \"Not Registered\" and \"Voice over LTE\" toggle is \"OFF\". In One UI 3.1, \"IMS Registration\" status is \"Registered\" and \"Voice over LTE\" toggle is \"ON\".\nUsers outside US: Please don't install OneUI 4 until this issue is fixed.\nThanks,\nAPS\nOneUI 3.1 (VoLTE toggle is ON)\nOneUI 3.1 (IMS Registered)\nOneUI 4.0 (VoLTE toggle is OFF)\nOneUI 4.0 (IMS Not Registered)",

Another weird thing that happened is this: When i first purchased it, it got so hot it scared me so much that i called Samsung from my other phone to report it.

      "text": "On December 23rd 2021, I regret to say that I fell into the trap of buying a new Samsung Galaxy s21 under Samsung's Trade-in program. They offered $500 of bonus credit and $55 when I sent in my perfectly working Samsung Galaxy s9.\nNow I have been a Samsung customer for a long time - s5, s6, s7, s9 and now the s21. I have never disliked Samsung, in fact I always supported the brand. Until now.\nShortly after sending in my phone, I received an email from Asurion (Samsung's super scammy 3rd party who handles trade-ins) saying they'll be charging my bank card because I never sent it in.\nI knew I had sent it, so I ignored it.\nA few days later, I get another email from Asurion saying that I *Did* send it in, but it wasn't in a good enough condition, so they'll be charging me $100. Which is of course $45 MORE than the rebate they offered in the first place.\nI offer an email rebuttal and ask for a photo. They then try to say they've changed it to $55 now, and lo and behold, a charge for $55 appears on my bank statement from Asurion.\nNow I'm not one to make a big deal out of things but this really, really, really **bleep** me off. I would never have touched the s21 if I knew I would be scammed out of my phone. I loved my s9, and in many ways it was a better phone than the s21.\nI would implore ANYONE who is reading this to not tempt fate, do NOT use the Tradeup program even if they offer you money, and DO NOT stay with Samsung because their customer service quality is so low, it's deeper than Hades.\nNo chat, call, or email support from Samsung is willing to help - they all just say \"we can't help, you have to email Asurion\". Sure mate, let me just ASK THE PEOPLE WHO STOLE MY MONEY for MY MONEY BACK. That will work.\nSo deeply disappointed in Samsung and this entire experience.",

I read with interest the following article about Samsung scratching their heads trying to figure out why:\nhttps://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/samsung-galaxy-s21-sales-poor/\nI normally upgrade to the latest S model every two years, when the latest and greatest arrives. I've done that for the S10+, S8+ and S6. But I didn't do it this year. Now it seems that I'm not the only one who has dropped the idea of upgrading.... and heres the key reason why we haven't bought the latest (when we normally would do so): \nHey, Samsung, this is a no-brainer:  you seriously DOWNGRADED the phone's storage capability by removing expandable storage (i.e., an SD card). This is the same dumb thing that Apple does. The problem is Samsung has been dumber, because they removed something that was clearly one big reason why Apple customers have jumped ship to Samsung. And why Samsung customers have stayed.\nThen Samsung insulted long-time Samsung mobile owners by not at least upgrading the base internal storage from 128 to 256 Gb to compensate for this.\nThat's two big dumb moves from Samsung. It's that sort of thing that is turning customers off. Samsung made the same dumb decision by removing expandable storage with the S6, but they got smart again and returned it to the S7.\nLet's hope Samsung gets this. Storage is a majorly huge issue when it comes to a smartphone. And the #1 reason -- by far -- that more storage is needed is photos and videos. Now we have very high resolution photos (108 megapixels) and that means far bigger photo files and 8K video, meaning WAY bigger video files. And Samsung REMOVES expandable storage? Really, Samsung?\nSamsung could argue, well photo and video taking runs so much better on internal storage. Granted. However, today's SD cards have incredible throughput. They are far more capabable than even a few years ago. Samsung has always been about consumer choice. Expandable storage is a critical choice.\nSamsung.... smell the coffee. S21 sales are down because you did dumb. Either return expandable storage in next year's lineup (very smart) or at least increase the base storage if you insist on removing expandable storage (not as smart).\nHopefully, someone at Samsung with some decision making capability is paying attention to this. it's not rocket science. Let's get that expandable storage back, Samsung!",

The S8 was the last one I had that actually took decent pictures. Starting with my s9, Samsung slowly started their saturation creep. The S20 series and S21 series pictures are just way too saturated. I don't know who in the marketing department did tests, but the pictures are too unrealistic to color in real life. We don't need overly greens, super blue skies and bright reds. The whole image in general is just too saturated. Comparing pics side by side taken with the S8, the S8 has much better pictures. The sensor is so much better on the S21, but ruined by post processing. A tad too much noise reduction making images muddy, and again, the over saturation. We shouldn't have to post process every picture.\n\nI never had an iPhone and never want one, but their camera is light years ahead. I absolutely love how their images look, and they are LIFELIKE. No need for all the extra saturation. I wish Samsung took this seriously and make the pictures look like the S8 series again. Videos are the same mess. Too much saturation. Who thinks this is okay??\n\nPro mode makes the colors look better, but usually too dark. I also can never get a sharp picture using pro mode, no matter the settings. Always fuzzy, even on lightroom. I just want a decent phone picture, out of the box like apple. And I don't even like apple. If they changed their file structure, would probably get one.\nPlease Samsung, turn down the saturation on the photos and reduce noise reduction just a little bit. ",

What I mean by this is when you restart the phone. Usually unlocking the phone right after a restart leads to loading. This isn't a big problem, but it would make the One Ui 4 experience smoother if we didn't notice the loading. Same with changing the color palettes. When you change them, the phone delays a bit then works as normal. A suggestion I would have would be to pre-load One Ui 4 possibly during the 2nd \"Samsung Galaxy\" screen. And for the color palettes give an ongoing message letting users know that the color palette is being applied while preventing them from going to the home screen before its finish. I believe if these were implemented, One Ui 4 would become an even smoother experience for everyone.",

I also know Samsung was aware of this problem and sent out a fix. \nI downloaded and installed the fix this morning but the fix did not take care of my restarting problem. It happened twice already. Anybody else having this issue and will it ever be fixed??",

For some reason audio only records in Mono Audio in a number of different apps including the stock camera app. So for those not aware this means that it only plays back the audio through one speaker or if you're wearing headphones only one ear. If I use the voice recording app the stereo sound works just fine. This has never been the case until the Android 12 One UI4 update.  It has made the audio playback quality abysmal. I have troubleshooted the phone done a factory reset and debugged the phone. IT IS NOT A HARDWARE ISSUE!! Call centre was unhelpful. If I could roll back to android 11.

I am not profoundly deaf; I have moderate to severe hearing loss. \nI have since been told by an Oticon representative; the hearing aids are NOT compatible with my Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G.  He told me my phone was  “too high end”, and I should just wear the aids and not use the app/blue-tooth/remote benefits………what???\nHe said they are compatible with a Samsung Galaxy S21, but NOT the Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G.\nSince they are not compatible, they only work “sometimes”, with the Oticon On app.\nWhile blue-toothed to my phone, sometimes the right ear works, sometimes the left ear works, every now and then, they both work at the same time as they should.\nWhen on the phone, calls are NEVER loud enough though the aids and the Oticon On app have them turned up as high as the aids and phone will go.  When driving, I can barely hear the other person at all.  In a very quiet office setting they are adequate, if the phone is turned up as loud as possible.\nI have worked with my audiologist along with HER representative at Oticon.  I have driven back and forth to the audiologist’s office at least 8 times now (25 miles each way), I have only had the aids about three weeks. Settings have been changed, programs have been added and adjusted.  The aids are still not loud enough when on the phone and the left and right ear fade in and out whenever……\nIt was intimated that this is a Samsung problem and not an Oticon problem.  \nCan this be true?? That it’s Samsung’s problem and not Oticon’s??\nIf my phone is NOT compatible with these hearing aids now, will there EVER be a software update that WILL make them compatible with my hearing aids and if so, when should I be expecting that update?\nAs anyone knows reading this, the hearing aids are not cheap, nor is a Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G. \nWhile once excited about the prospect of a new phone and hearing aids, I am disappointed and frustrated and I feel both Samsung and Oticon have totally misrepresented their products.\nIs there ANYONE that can verify for me that my Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G is or is NOT compatible with Oticon More 3 minirite hearing aids.\nIf it is NOT compatible, can you please tell me which hearing aid brands AND models, DO work properly with this phone.\nThanks for reading and any help you can provide.",

      "text": "My Galaxy S21 Ultra will probably be my last Samsung phone. How can you refer to something as \"ultra\" if it is missing commonly used functionality of earlier phones.\nNo SPO2 sensor? So obviously Samsung is no longer interested in supporting personal health without forcing you to buy a watch. Added an Active 2 watch to my S10+a few years ago, because it supposedly supported automated health monitoring, but they did not activate the full sensor package until the Active 3, so while it did SOME things, there were other bits of functionality that never worked (e.g. ECG). According to the app, it's not supported in my location -- Colorado. I have to keep my old S10+ around for measuring blood oxygen levels.\nNo external memory card? No, the phone cannot qualify as \"ultra\" without that.\nPricing is a game for Samsung. A week or so before Thanksgiving, I was ordering my S21 Ultra and S Pen Pro, and it showed I was going to be saving over $700! I needed to help my wife with something, and when I came back to complete and submit the order, the page refreshed and the savings dropped to about $300. Customer Service people were no help, except to say I should order it on Black Friday, as that is the best deal. I watched the prices go up higher and higher until Black Friday, and the Black Friday sale price was still more than the original quoted price. On top of that, their military discount was not \"30% through the end of the year\" as indicated in the VA newsletter. I got 2.3%, which didn't even cover taxes. That doesn't spell appreciation to us.\nThe S21 Ultra is not the only thing that failed to live up to expectations. The S Pen Pro was advertised as being flexible enough to cover multiple devices. Again, a substandard product. It works on the S21 only -- and does not even provide support for capacitive contact, therefore it won't work on other devices -- Samsung or otherwise. \nTo sum it up, Samsung has lost sight on what's important for so many people. These are not ultra devices, but diet versions of past products. The S Pen is not a \"Pro\" device if technology professionals like myself cannot use it across multiple devices. The price scam was the last straw for me. I've been recommending my friends and family compare Samsung devices to OnePlus devices, which are sold at a more reasonable price, if you don't mind sacrificing a little on camera megapixels. \nWhat a shame! Samsung started out so well. It's a shame they can't maintain it.",

Very helpfull and all. But after three factory reset I contacted their service center in DK and they got it in for repair.\nFrom the repair list they changed most of the inside of the phone. \nNow it is doing the same again. Have to different sim card in the phone. Cannot connect to mobile network. Have changed the sim card, been around my carriers store. Same problem. No connection. Putting the sim cards in my Samsung S71. No problem. And ther are the same apps on my S71 as on the S21.\nI asked Samsung support for an exchange phone and the same at Mentech (Samsung service center in DK). Samsung support said that Mentech should decide, Mentech said it has to be at the repair shop 3 (THREE) times before getting a new one.  WHAT! \nBottom line is I am NOT a very happy customer. First I have a very expensive phone that is not working as it should, second what about all the hours of work I have put in to dealing with this problem? Factory resetting( 4-5 times, as this is the holy gral of support), driving to service center, cell store, phone support and all the bad karma.  I think it add up to like 3-4 working days. Can I maybe sent Samsung the bill? \nI can see that there are more out there with that problem. \nIs there any solution to this or should I just ask to return my phone and get a refund? Thank good it is not a car.\nAnyone with good advise or having the same happy feeling about their S21? Or how to get a refund, new phone, paid for the hours that I spend. \nHave a great day out there. \nRegards kenneth...",

Then it got delayed again and now it's just saying there's a delay and there's no date available. But what is funny is when I originally ordered it the phantom black was completely out of stock and would not let me order it but now if I go online to order the T-Mobile as 21 Ultra the phantom black is in stock and technically says it would be delivered by the end of this week if I ordered it today and the phantom silver says only available in unlocked. So is the T-Mobile one completely out of stock and I'm never going to get my phone but I've got too many discounts and trade-in offers that I used to cancel it and order it again I would end up paying double of what I paid originally. And when I called e-commerce department they just said they can expedite my order to the top of the list but I'm sure they tell everyone. My thing is they should know why there's a delay are the phone stuck on a cargo ship outside the Port of Los Angeles do they not have any physically in stock at any warehouse's or did they get like 10,000 orders and they only have like 6,000 in stock so the first 6,000 people will get it but we have to wait till they make more I mean there's got to be a legit answer. They just keep saying call e-commerce and they can update you but I have twice and they have no answers they should have all the answers. I mean they either have none manufactured or they're stuck on a boat on their way over or they just have too many orders and it's just taking longer to process them thinking they're going to get out you know a thousand a week and they only getting out like 200 so it's just taking longer than normal I mean a simple question with a simple answer. But what I want to know is why it kept giving me a new delivery date if they physically don't have them in a warehouse there should not even be an estimated delivery date their system should be able to know that so if you are giving me an estimated delivery date that means you have it in stock and it's just a matter of my order is next in queue or however you want to word it. I'm sure someone here from Samsung knows a definitive answer. Cuz this is getting frustrated my phone currently is acting up and I want to get my new one before this one gives out on me. ",

Read this all the way through before replying, as most of the things that will be suggested to me have already been considered, done, or are not available to me.\n  I bought my S21 ULTRA (Unlocked) on 03/26/2021. I was using it on Verizon for several months with no issues outside of Verizon's awful coverage in my area. Last week (08/18/2021) the phone started to randomly shut itself off after dropping cell signal. I have the same exact thing happening with my AT&T sim as well, even though I have much better signal strength. From what I could tell I was not having overheating issues (I have see that floating around as a major issue of the entire S21 lineup), with my highest core temps being around 60C (should not be an issue for modern silicon to operate at that temperature), battery never exceeding 30 or 40C.\n  I started digging around trying to find solutions on my own, here is what I tried:\nAirplane mode on then off\nReset Network Settings (Probably done this about 100 times now)\nClear Cache (Via the bootloader menu - where you power down the device then power it on while holding the volume up button w/power)\nReseating the Sim \nCleaning Sim card and Sim Tray/Slot (I have an anti-static blower made for cleaning electronics)\nFactory Reset (Both in the settings menu and in the bootloader menu)\nNothing had worked, so I finally broke down and made the drive to my nearest authorized Samsung repair center (about an hour away). They \"factory reset\" the device (at a deeper level than what the user can do through software). That seemed to have fixed the issue. My drive up there had the device losing service multiple times and restart once, had almost perfect signal the whole way back. This was 2 days ago (8/23/2021).\nYesterday the device restarted itself unprompted and started dropping signal again. This was all while being virtually right beside a cell tower for my carrier, so signal strength would not be the cause.\nToday I have been pretty much unable to use the device without being on wifi.\nI have no issues with wifi connectivity. At all. When cellular works, I get expected speeds for my area.\nI will note that I am not on the most current software for the device. I will be updating after I post this to see if Samsung issued a software patch for this issue (I am currently operating under the belief this is some software issue and not hardware).\nI haven't had any sort of overheating problems with the phone. I've seen plenty of stuff floating around about that and I haven't seen it on my device.\nI was wondering if anybody else is having this issue, and if so how many people might be affected...\nKinda defeats the purpose of a phone if it can't keep cellular connectivity!",

And since the Grey highlight of the notifications is fairly opaque, I can't see anything that's behind the notification. It's extremely frustrating!!!\nMy phone didn't used to have this issue, the notification used to go away in just a few seconds, but now it takes minutes.\n The only reason I can think of that my phone would have this issue after moving is that my uncle's 3-year-old daughters were playing with my phone while he helped me move across town. We both made sure the girls never dropped the phone, but the girls were tapping on all kinds of buttons on the screen and even managed to post a picture of themselves on my Instagram story! 😂😂😂\n My cousins' tapping around on my phone gives me a little bit of hope that can be fixed if I just know where to go in my settings. Maybe the issue started simply due to them tapping on something they shouldn't have.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny help or suggestions would be SO appreciated!!!",

My phone is currently storing thousands of photographs and I want to move/protect/file them immediately. \nI would love to know when this is going to be addressed.

Now that Black Friday deals are out, I think I'm going to buy a Google Pixel. The software on Samsung devices just doesn't make the cut. I'm sure it's fine for some people, but having an Android device comes with its limitations and having a Samsung device brings even more issues. I have had a Samsung phone since the Galaxy S6. Some of the things are great. A lot of the things are awful. I'm not sure why I'm posting this here. I just wanted to put it somewhere. The software is buggy at best, the lack of true Android 12 implementation is really the last straw.\nDo you know why your camera app looks absolute **bleep** on apps that didn't come with the phone? That's Samsung's fault. It's not some sort of Android quirk. Samsung doesn't allow full camera integration for any third-party apps.\nI just can't believe that I thought that all these issues were because I was usually running a phone that was a couple models old. I can't believe I spent so much money on this New device and the only benefit I've seen is the 10x zoom lense on the camera.\nI can't believe I'm still dealing with problems I had four years ago. I'm not saying that Google Pixel phones are better in hardware. Actually, it's pretty understood that they're not. But what good is all this shiny new stuff if the software hasn't kept up? I'm so tired of having to deal with all the little Samsung things. It's amazing that I have the best of the best when it comes to Android phones and for the first time ever, I'm actually questioning whether or not I should move to Apple. I don't even like iOS.

Set the shutter to a speed commensurate with both the sport and the lens I'm shooting with, and adjust the aperture so that I can get good isolation of the subject and then set the iso to auto to adapt to the varying lighting conditions.  I'd much rather have a photo which was a little noisy because of a high iso than one that was blurry because of too slow a shutter speed.\nWhen I bought the Ultra I was immediately disappointed with the fact that there was no auto iso in Pro Mode which meant to shoot with a fast shutter, I had to continually manually adjust the iso as the lighting conditions changed.\nI'm not sure when it happened, perhaps with Android 12, but now the iso can be set in auto or manual.\nThat means that using Pro Mode with the shutter set for my softball speed which is 1/640 using my f2.8 zoom, I can now set the shutter in the Camera pro mode for 1/750, AF=on, iso=auto and as I pan around for the shot the iso makes an attempt to keep up with the varying lighting conditions. It works pretty good though not as well as my Nikon and on an overcast day I thought the shots were consistently underexposed, so I bumped the exposure up to +1EV.\nNow this was only my first few minutes playing with this and I know the below photo's are not good quality but they do show you that with Pro mode with auto iso and a high shutter speed, you can freeze a moving subject.\nHere are two pics of cars traveling at about 55mph while I stand still and snap the shot as they pass through the frame.  The blue car exhibits motion blue and it was taken with the camera in Photo Mode....something we've all experienced with Photo Mode but I do feel that this is better than before.  The white car was taken in Pro mode and while both suffer with focus as I didn't tap the auto focus on, the white car does not exhibit motion blur.\nAgain, please excuse the poor quality but I hope to actually spend more than a minute or two playing with this over the next few days and hopefully I'll have something better to post.\n  ** If my response helps, please click on Like (Heart).

After I installed the Novemember system update, it only fixed it for about two weeks, now it's been doing it again. Any known reasons why this is happening? Any solutions to fix it?",

These settings include:\n\n\nUsing Force 4x MSAA\n\n\nChanging the transition animations to 0\n\n\nUsing the 120 hz adaptive smoothness\n\n\nPutting the processing speed to high or max\n\n\nIncreasing the Guardian Temperature threshold\n\n\nClosing every single app except the game and YouTube (the main app I use to multi task with)\n\n\nAnd Using Game Boosters as well as Samsung's Game Plug-Ins on max settings.\ne Boosters as well as Samsung's Game Plug-Ins on max settings.\n\n\nIf this is the norm for every Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultras and cannot be fixed then I guess I would just shrug and believe I couldn't do anything about it.\n\nI.e. If the phone couldn't physically handle it as there isn't enough CPU usage then I guess there isn't anything to do.\n\nIf this is caused by the One UI 4, a setting that I put, etc then I would want to possibly fix it or know that others also go through this (because of the Update) so maybe Samsung may fix it.\n\nIdk, at first I didn't mind it but I notice in areas where the phone has to put in a little bit of work in an area, if I have Pop up or PiP the phone TANKS in the Frame Rate. *Sigh*\n\nIt's also frustrating because it happens inconsistently.

Would also love the \"Play next\" option for songs, to play one next.\n\n6- Compass apparently is **bleep**ed up, everytime I'm on Google maps I have to or show the street (Live View option) or do the 8 figure for it to \"calibrate\" and get its **bleep** together, but even if I do it right now and calibrate it, if I close the app and open it again right there, guess what? Exactly, I'll have to do it again. (This was before Android 12 too)\n\n\nI don't know if there are any more problems with this update and/or Android 12 update, but these are the ones I'm experiencing.\n\nWith all of this issues compounded, and if this is the best experience one could get with Android, **bleep**, you're making it WAYYYYY to easy for Apple.\n\nHope all of this gets solved.",

It was working fine, then at 8 PM it mysteriously stopped working right. I could push the home button, I could swipe from the top and swipe notifications (or open them), but I could not open any apps, I could swipe between app screens, I couldn't hang up an incoming phone call.  If I restarted it, it would work as normal for a minute or two, then go right back to how it was. In the morning, it was working fine again. Since then I've noticed it seems to do this same thing between 8 PM until 7 AM, just not working right, but at 7 AM all is as it should be. There was a short window of time that it worked around 9:30 PM one night abut then the next day it updated again and it's back to doing what it was before. I've chatted with someone at Samsung who told me to take it to a Samsung retailer for service, but we don't have any near me. Has anyone else had this issue? It's super weird! ",

Phone is now unlocking/interacting with my leg while in the pocket.\nSince the last update it seems the unintentional interaction has become rather frequent and its constantly changing music/jumping around when the phone is in my pocket and the screen is facing my leg. Up until recently never had this issue (I am using the Always on Display feature).\n2. Always-on display's top menu info is not aligned to top edge of the screen.\nIt seems the feature isnt aware of the actual screen size & boundaries, and is putting it in the wrong location (i guess it might be the normal S21 location?)\n           3. Drop-down menu is cutting off the last label.\nSince last update last tab is being cut off, same as when I click to expand on it.\n         4.  When in landscape more there is a hole in the tabs under the music label.\nRather self explanatory.\n4.a. It is also a lot harder to interact with the music buttons since the last update, need to try really hard for it. It happens with multiple music/podcast apps, so its not tied to 1 app.\nHope this is the right place for bug reporting, as I couldnt find a better suited location.",

This has been happening on 2 different devices since my first replacement. There is no dust blocking the microphones. I believe the noise reduction processing in the configuration is too aggressive and there should be an option in the settings to reduce this effect globally across the phone.

That should have been easily solved and why nobody else new to do this is beyond me. I'd still like to know how to turn off Bixby voice window that keeps popping up. I don't know what Bixby is and I don't know why it takes up so much of my memory with apps that I cannot delete.",

Anyways next up freezing, not sure why but this phone stutters time to time and I'm not the type of person to watch questionable videos or look up weird things, and I don't download fake apps, just take pictures post look at my bank check my stocks and watch YouTube and that's it and it just freezes can't be low on ram storage ecauuse it's at 5.6gb out of 8.0gb and can't be my storage I still have 80gb left so I'm not sure what's going on but again I never had any problems with the s10+ and sometimes the apps on the s21 ultra would freeze and crash.

Unfortunately, after the restart, the device still gave me that prompt, and wouldn't let me use the device unless I backed out of it (it would then pop up again after a couple of seconds). At first, I thought it was an issue with Xfinity, but I went over to my local store, and call technical support and it wasn't anything on there and. The phone was already unlocked. I then went to my carrier to try and see if it was something with my SIM. Couldn't find anything either, other customers have used my type of SIM into newer phones and it would work just fine. Even after resetting the network settings, changing my access point name, and inputting my S21's IMEI into my Cricket plan nothing changed. It is very odd, the S21 still acknowledges that there is a SIM inside the phone, and it can receive calls- I just can't use the phone without dismissing that prompt. I was told by a Samsung technical support technician to visit my local authorized repair center, and if they couldn't fix it, I would have to factory reset the phone with the old SIM inside. However I don't think it's something wrong with the phone. \nHas anyone had this issue before?",

This really is as simple as them adding the codec to the Android OS. Their solution they've posted is find a player that supports it. And while my music app Power Amp does. It's not an alarm app and I can't find an alarm app that supports its own codecs. Their current response is unacceptable for such an expensive product theyve cut so many features off of.

The items below to me would make the perfect phone that everyone would buy I believe.\nMake everything just like the S21 Ultra with the below suggestions.\n1. Keep S21 ultra brightness. This is great.\n2. S21 cameras are great, but better camera system like pixel 6 pro.\n3. Bring back the IR blaster infrared remote control system like in S6 model.\n4. Bring back the Earphone jack.\n5. FM radio - turn on the FM radio chip, not tied to a carrier turning on the chip. This is very useful in emergency situations when power and cell towers are out. Phone becomes worthless without it.\n6. Better speakers and sound system. Make a top firing speaker in the top of the phone just like the bottom firing speaker, instead of using the ear piece. Add a sub-woofer. More bass and umpff at low and loud volumes. This suggestion (#6) alone would make me very happy.\n7. Wider phone like the note series.\n8. Finger print reader on back of phone like S9 model. Currently need 2 hands to use finger print reader.\n9. Make phone rugged - don't need to get a case.\n10. Bring back the notification light.\n11. Flat screen - no curve on edge.\n12. All phones unlocked. Should be up to user who they  connect to.\n13. Solar charging. Phone charges in any light when not plugged into regular charger. This would be great in a survival situation.\n14. Bring back expanded storage.\n15. Quit the smaller bezel stuff. Do a smaller screen with bigger bezels to fit in above stuff. A thicker phone would not be bad either. They are too thin and slippery now.\nJust think, if Samsung came out with a phone with all the above, wouldn't you be extremely interested in this. I think it would beat out all the competition.\nThanks much.",

The text in notifications is a bit small. Yes, this can be adjusted with the overall zoom and font size, but that changes everything. Right now, the only thing that's smaller than it should be is the notifications. Everything else is as it was and looks normal (I've tried changing the zoom and text size up and down in order to reset, as suggested in a few places)\nI see a bunch of annoyances with the gallery app and sharing:\n2. Where is the option to ALWAYS remove location from shared images? I recall this being an option before. I see there's an annoying/obscure way to do it per image (see screenshots), but I can't find an overall option to always remove location tags when sharing.\n3. Where's the option to convert shared images from HEIF to jpg? Wasn't this an option before? Is this being done automatically now? What if someone wants to share HEIF images? \n4. What about the options for HDR/HEVC videos? Seems there was previously an option for converting these, as well. There's an option in Quick Share for videos, but...wouldn't that only apply to items shared through Quick Share?\n5. Videos used to loop play. This was removed (before android 12). Why not give users an option for this? Many people would like to have this for an option, myself included.\n5. The new share panel has positives and negatives. Quick share being permanently stuck in the first spot is stupid. Stop trying to make us use things that you (Samsung) think are cool. I will be seeing if disabling the Quick share package gets rid of this. When there are only 5 spots, each one is important\n6. Why is it not possible to swipe up on this to see all of your apps? This sideways scroll and then the button to see more is just...bad. It was much simpler and intuitive before, with the swiping up. It's even more confusing as this current share panel looks like you can swipe it up, just like before. \n To remove location you must click the little More> after which this pops up:\n If anyone sees options that I'm missing somewhere, please let me know.",

After the reset it would still restart at random times about twice a day.  I took it to Best Buy Geek Squad and they reinstalled the software, but then it continued to restart as I am scrolling through apps, using the camera, making a phone call.  I sent it to Samsung for repair, but Samsung stated they performed tests and could not find anything wrong with the phone.  They ended up sending it back to me, I received it today and as I was setting up the phone it randomly restarted as I was setting up facial recognition.  I talked to Samsung customer service and sent it back for repair again, but I am started to feel defeated.  Has anyone been able to resolve this issue?

Sure an SD card would be nice but I pay 30 dollars a year for 200gb of cloud storage and in reality I prefer cloud because I don't have to worry about an SD card becoming corrupt. People complain about not getting a charging brick. Let's be real they are selling this phone for 200 cheaper than the s20 so paying 15 dollars for a new charging brick isn't a biggie..and the plastic back gets hate and I LOVE it. I have a 3 year old and I much prefer not worrying about both sides of my phone breaking. It makes the phone physically lighter and still looks premium. People think a glass back is premium BECAUSE that's what phone manufacturers tell US is premium because they make bank off of back glass replacements. I hear all the time people saying the s21 has bad battery life but mine doesn't. If I am using my phone without power saving mode on I get 6-7 hours of screen on time and with power savings turned on I get 8-10 hours of screen on time.  I did come from the moto g power that got 16 hours of screen on time but the phone was uncomfortably heavy in the hand. I ALMOST traded in my s21 for the zflip 3 but 3 hours of screen on time is unacceptable especially if you plan to keep it for a few years with battery degradation. Samsung if your listening make a flip next year with solid battery life and I'll switch!! They could make a cheap model with less battery and a more expensive model with a bigger battery.

Maybe it will be heard?\nSamsung was always the phone that offered freedom to its users in terms of what they could do with their phone. They had expandable storage, changeable, batteries, more flexible software with unlockable bootloaders, cool features like Gear VR and DEX.\nOver the years I have been a Galaxy fan boy, and have converted many lifelong apple users because it was a no brainer for some because of the freedom Samsung gave its users; even though Apple had better apps, better graphics, better cameras, better operating experience because of their inhouse software and hardware.\nBut over time, Samsung has slowly cut out all of the things that made them different from apple; otherwise known as UPS's (unique selling propositions) in marketing terms. And I understand why many of them needed to happen, such as the removable battery and headphone jack.\nHowever the recent removal of the SD card slot may mark the final straw. Without it there just isn't enough to keep Samsung users from the better app support, performance, and 3rd party support of Apple. It seems the Samsung is trying to be like Apple, but when they do that, they will lose, because Apple has been doing it longer and better. \nWith advanced high resolution camera's, it simply doesn't make since to have limited, non-expandable memory. A lot of people like me aren't in the city and cell reception isn't reliable, so cloud storage is not an option. But beyond storage space, removable storage is also very important if the phone becomes damaged or corrupted, because files can be saved by simply removing the card.\nI get many don't use SD card slots, but including a SD slot doesn't hurt or turn anyone away. But removing it slaps many of Samsung loyal users in the face. The SD card slot is the reason my last 3 phones have been Samsung. I am not saying it needs to be on every device Samsung makes, but at least include it on the Ultra line, I don't mind paying a premium for the features that are important to me.\nIf the S22 Ultra doesn't have a SD slot, I will try to hold out one more year with my S8+ to see if the the S23 has it. But if the S23 doesn't have it, then users should decide between the Iphone or the Pixel for more pure operation experiences since Samsung has give up everything that made it unique. At that point there really isn't a reason for the Galaxy to exist.\nI know there will be some that disagree, but this is my 2 cents. I don't think I am the only one.",

It will just randomly switch back to the theme keyboard. I've had issues with my galaxy s21 since I got it in February but for some reason now there isn't a store I can take it to too have it looked at when a couple years ago there was multiple stores I could take it to around me. I don't like that you have to mail the phone in and have to pay if samsung says there isn't a software issue or anything wrong with it. If i have to mail it in, wait, and possibly have to pay for something than it makes more sense for me to make an insurance claim with my phone provider but i shouldnt have to do that if theres been an issue with the phone since a got it.

I don't want to spend hours figuring it out as I go.\nPersonal comment: Technology is supposed to save us time. Pushing out new versions without adequate documentation forces us to spend hours \"playing with\" our phones. I use mine for business and productivity (not for playing) - but over the years I have spent hundreds, probably thousands of hours learning new tech that eventually becomes obsolete (I'm including PC software). Some of this goes with the territory, but MOST of it is because the companies behind the software are saving THEIR time, at the cost of MINE. For this reason, we should ALL have a choice in accepting a new update OR NOT.\nBTW: The URL link provided at the bottom of the What's New screen (as seen on the Software Update page on the phone) goes to the right place - a page full of past updates with explanations, but THIS UPDATE is not yet listed! The last one is Build G991USQS4AUIR (for my model SM-G991U).",

The screen flickers black, the orientation is forced from horizontal to vertical, and any media (video or audio) either stops entirely or is minimised and paused. This also causes messages being typed out in some applications like Messenger to be erased if it freezes before I have finished writing them. This is especially frustrating in a product I wanted particularly for the high quality of its display, and which cost as much as my laptop. (EDIT: it doesn't seem to happen in Safe Mode).\nI imagine the clicking sound is from some loose component inside the phone but I have no idea what has caused the other two issues. Does anyone have any idea what has gone wrong or for a possible solution? image/videos can be supplied if needed",

When I go to the keyboard settings under General management the default keyboard shows as \"Google Voice Typing [Legacy]\" instead of \"Samsung Keyboard.\" Once I change it back, the keyboard reappears. Also, at this point, my only 2 keyboard options are the two mentioned above.\nI'm not sure which of these steps fixed my issue, but I started by disabling \"Google Voice Typing [Legacy]\" keyboard in my \"Keyboard list and default\" settings menu. Then I uninstalled Google Assistant, disabled my \"Google\" app, and restarted my phone. After the reboot, the \"Google Voice Typing\" option showed up in my \"Keyboard list and default\" settings menu without the \"[Legacy]\" annotation.  Now with this new keyboard enabled, when my Samsung Keyboard is open I can tap the keyboard icon in the lower right corner and change the input to Google Voice Typing for speech-to-text.\nI hope this helps someone else who has this same issue.

If you're going to charge a thousand dollars+ for a phone - we should be able to control which apps we keep, and which ones we don't. We shouldn't have to risk bricking our phone by rooting it - in order to delete apps off our phones. Samsung must be getting paid bank by the developers of those apps, to FORCE us to have them on our phones.\n The ONLY good thing about these phones is the cameras.\n There's no more SD card. Probably because Samsung is getting kickbacks from the cloud services to force us into using cloud storage - instead of being able to store our photos/videos on the actual phone itself. I don't want my pics/vids vulnerable to hackers and the potential to be lost forever if there's a tech issue with the cloud server.\nThe stupid phones also need to stop trying to do stuff for me that I don't want them to do. For example bringing up the samsung screen asking me if I want to store my PW with samsung EVERY time I try to enter a password somewhere -- or now allowing me to crop my photos without jumping to preset dimensions because it THINKS it knows where the edges are, but does not. You have to accept the preset dimensions, or take a screen shot, and edit it in the actual photo editor in order to get it the way you want.\nOh, and no way to set your phone to automatically open in the video player. Clicking the video brings up a preview of the video, then you have to go to a menu to open it in video player.\nMy S21 Ultra 5G will be the last samsung phone I ever buy (I have been a loyal samsung user for over a decade). The phones suck, and their customer service blows. And every release it gets worse.\nScrew samsung. My next phone will be a pixel. And from the looks of it - I'm not the only one who feels this way.\nIf samsung doesn't get their acts together, they're going to lose a lot of customers.\nStop trying to be like apple. Your customers buy your phones because they're not like iphones. Well they weren't. Now it's pretty much impossible to tell them apart.",

I may be switching from Samsung products as well(I have the earbuds and watch from you guys so I would be extremely sad to switch to Apple but have been basically been told my problems are irrelevant). The only reason they even attempted to fix my phone was because of possibility of property damage which is ridiculous their phone could either cause a fire or burn my leg. After sending my phone in through the mail because there are no close-by repair centers I went two weeks without my phone just to be told that they didn't do anything with it. They supposedly launched it up when it didn't immediately reboot they sent it back claiming there was no issue. This isn't even a whole month later and my phone is unusable again. Thanks Samsung.",

And I found a scrolling issue with many apps. When I have my finger on the screen, the screen refresh rate is at 120Hz. But immediately when I lift my finger, the refresh rate drops to 60Hz. It didn't exist with the previous system (One UI 3.1, Android 11), and it is extremely annoying as it makes the scrolling feel really stuttering.\n The list of the problematic apps that I have tried so far is, Play Store, Gmail, Chrome, Google Drive, Google Podcasts, Twitter, Amazon, Reddit, Weibo and WeChat. Even some of the Samsung's own app have this issue, like Galaxy Store, Gallery, Internet browser. Some other apps like YouTube do not have this issue. Moreover, the overall smoothness of the system is not as good as One UI 3.1.\n I talked to the famous Ice universe on Weibo about it, and it appears this issue is very similar to the One UI 4 beta 2 version released in China and it had been solved in the beta 3 of the Chinese version. I think a fix is definitely needed for the US version of One UI 4!\n Thanks!",

Also please fix the shutter lag on S21 and very soft low bitrate of videos in any resolution. Lastly to add more sense of fluency and continuity, in app switcher please make it so that the preview of the actual app is shown in the app switcher instead of just a black or blank screen especially in the camera where it turns black when you go to switch apps. And please remove the automatic brightness of the screen when the camera is open, maybe that’s what causing the lags and scene optimizer and the disconnected vibration settings, qr code and document scanner turned making it slow down.

I would like the following features to be added in future updates (for example, One UI 4):\nI would like the following features to be added to the system Camera app:\n 1) keep the selected lens (zoom level) when switching camera modes;\n2) the ability to zoom in all camera modes (selfie, portrait, slow motion, etc.);\n3) Night mode in Portrait mode (like on the Galaxy S21 Ultra, because this is a software feature, not a hardware one);\n4) the ability to use all lenses (ultra wide, telephoto) in some shooting modes – Slow motion (for example, you can shoot 120 FPS video on an ultra wide lens, therefore you can add slow motion), Pro, Hyperlapse;\n5) the ability to use the flash when shooting with an ultra wide lens (possible in third-party apps), as well as in super stabilization mode;\n6) the ability to adjust the exposure time in the night mode (not just choosing \"Max.\", but choose seconds);\n7) flash (screen backlight) when recording video on the front camera (implemented in Google Camera);\n😎 the ability to switch between lenses while recording video in the UHD 60 FPS format (currently I can switch to the front camera, but in my opinion, switching to an ultra-wide-angle lens is much more useful);\n9) the ability to forcibly select a telephoto lens in night mode;\n10) video stabilization in the Portrait video mode;\n11) auto frame rate mode when recording video in UHD format (at least 24/30 FPS);\n12) higher HDR when recording video (it's so good in photo, but not enough in video).\n Allow third party camera apps to:\n 1) use all lenses (ultra wide angle, telephoto), in particular, provide access to the front camera on Snapdragon models (RAW support);\n2) use a larger exposure range when taking a photo (from 1/12000 sec. to 30 sec.);\n3) shoot video with different frame rates (60, 120, 240 FPS).\n ",

I have purchased all the accessories for the phone in anticipation of its arrival, to say I'm frustrated is an understatement. Now that the sale has ended and the offer has passed with a wasted two weeks, Samsung is only offering to refund my original amount without any further compensation or at least a price match of the supposed proper price that should have been offered during the sale.

Does this much Knox Enterprise come on every S21 Ultra? My phone is for personal-use only and there seems to be quite a lot of business-related logging and monitoring of my daily use? And.KLMS Security agents constantly running in the background? I can see log files saved to the internal storage but I dont have permission to view them. They're hidden. Basically there's a **bleep**-ton of business ware that came pre-loaded on this device, and it runs all the time. I'm beginning to resent being (blatantly) spied on.\n\nI have learned my lesson about carrier-branded phones. I should not have bought this AT&T Galaxy S21 Ultra. I should have opted for the unlocked version directly from Samsung. The best way to put it is, this phone just doesn't run right. The enterprise mobile security on here is ridiculous. Instead of the owner of my phone who's able to use it freely, I feel more like a managed user with zero permissions. I'm starting to wonder if I've received an AT&T Business phone intended for corporate use? Anything to help me understand the main differences between business and regular S21 Ultra from AT&T would be much appreciated. What would you do about it if you received a phone with software like this one has.....Any suggestions?\n\nThanks in advance for your perspective!\nBeth",

Occasionally it will auto connect, yet not show that I have internet when other devices show that there is internet.  In either case I have to turn WIFI on and then off again to find and connect to a know WIFI.\nAlso, Bluetooth acts much the same way.  Devices I know are showing will not appear as available on my phone and I have to turn Bluetooth off and back on again to find them.   \n\nWhen I asked my store about this they suggested I reset network settings, which seemed to help...However, I am resetting NS repeatedly now and thus resetting all Bluetooth and WIFI's.  It seems like I am constantly turning things on and off or resetting them.   I think my old Kyocera was better...\n\nAnyone have any ideas what to do next?",

If I turn off my VPN I am able to see my VMs on  my phone recently and push VM icon in the phone app to receive.  No dialing in needed.\nI tried to trouble shoot with my VPN provider but nothing except turn it off worked.  \nThis same VPN worked on my S8+ so what changed?  I did initially talk to Verizon about it since I never remember seeing the term Visual Voicemail even just the basic not premium type. The difference is that you don't see the \"message\" typed out but you do see that a VM was left and you just push on VM icon.\nAnyone else?  I'm about ready to dump my VPN (not just for this...)",

(thats why it's slow sometimes).\n*Fix sensitivity of Lift to wake feature like on ios.\n*Bigger icons on Quick panel like on ios and other devices. for easier reach like for wifi button bluetooth button, volume button, and brightness slider and music player.\n* Tap to wake instead of douple tap to wake. (if aod is not on) much easier.\n*Fix-Gesture navigation haptic feedback only when opening app switcher not on exiting an app. its too redundant\n*Fix- Bigger icons on homescreen with 5×6 layout, without having to use screen zoom.\n* AOD turns off when in pocket to save battery.\n*Camera flash assist when focusing in pro mode\n*Cuter/Better looking emojis \n*Just a couple of suggestions. This is just a short list, Hoping that Samsung Software Developer Team would be able to look into this. Pls like and share so it will be viewed by more people.

Unfortunately, that cable is a bit short for where we want to use it so I went on the search for a 6-10 foot cable. I would prefer to use an OEM cable but can't find such a thing and the reviews on many after market products contain posts that are quite concerning: dead after a short period and electrical shorts which can cause fires. YIKES!\nSo, I'm hoping that someone in the community can provide the part number for the Samsung product (if there is one) or an approved after market product.\nThanks,\nTerry",

This person has only successfully called me twice at random times without being sent straight to voicemail but every other time she calls it sends her straight to voicemail. She is able to text me and Duo me but she isn't able to make calls to me. The call long indicates \"Blocked Spam Call, Declined by Phone\". I am able to call her but she isn't able to call me unless for some odd reason my phone allows the call to go through. I've looked in the contacts setting and I don't have anything blocking her. She too is a Samnsung user, she has a SNOW 20 Ultra.  I have this contact marked on my favorites and have had them in my contacts forever. I never experienced this problem before and can't figure out how to allow her to be able to call me without having to text me and ask me to call her. Any suggestions would be helpful!

The issue that I'm having is my phone is on 5G all the time it literally never drops 5G until I make a phone call. Soon as I make a phone call it drops down to 4GLTE and my mobile voice network type drops from NR SA which I believe is (New Radio Stand Alone 5G if I'm not mistaken. My phone is always on 5G, 100% of the time until I make any call and my mobile voice network type is always on NR SA as well right up until I make any phone call. Could this be SIM card related perhaps? I still have the SIM that came new in the box with the s21 Ultra. Only reason they put a different SIM in my phone is because I had just gotten a new tmobile SIM card a week prior. They both say R15 on them, but the design on them are slightly different. How can I tell if this is affecting my VOLTE? I'm considering going back up to a tmobile store to register the SIM that came with the phone but I don't wanna waste my time if it's not the issue. They take hours in these stores to do anything and they try to charge me for every little thing.",

I used it for the first time last night, placing the phone on the charger on my nightstand, keeping the phone on for emergencies.\nIn the morning, it was at 100% as expected, but both the Phone and Charger were fairly warm to hot, which I didn't expect.  I assumed that once the phone reached 100%, it would switch to a trickle charge state, which wouldn't generate much heat.\nI have another older Samsung charger (EP-PG950), used with my prior Note 8, and neither the Note 8 nor the charger ever got noticeably warm.  I haven't tried this charger overnight with the S21 Ultra yet.\nSo this raises several questions:\nShould the phone and charger be that warm when left overnight?\nIs it detrimental to battery life and quality to routinely leave it on a charger (wireless or wired) overnight?\nCurrently, I have \"Fast Charging,\" \"Super fast charging\" and \"Fast wireless charging\" all enabled - would disabling some or all of these be best for overnight charging, and would this eliminate the heat problem?\nI've researched this, and inevitably find conflicting information on \"best practice\" in this regard, but am curious to see what knowledgeable members here think, perhaps specifically with regard to the S21 Ultra.\nThanks.",

It almost behaves like it already has a focus lock on something, and no attempts to focus on alternate subjects has any effect.\n If I switch to the Ultra-wide, the 3x tele, or the 10x tele, they all work exactly as expected and are in focus/can focus on other subjects with a tap. If I bring my hand up close to the lens and Focus Enhancer turns on (which I understand is just the phone switching to the ultra-wide), everything comes into focus, but then when I remove my hand it returns to the main camera and is out of focus.\nExample of what I’m describing can be seen here\nThis has been happening on my phone since the May release, and so far I’ve had three releases since, none of which has seemed to improve this behavior. Currently running G998U1UEU4AUF5\n Troubleshooting steps attempted thus far:\n Usually when this happens, I’ve tried a handful of steps which inconsistently seem to help. The aforementioned step of holding my hand close to the lens so focus enhancer turns on and then pulling it away (so it switches back to the main camera) will often be enough for it to seemingly correct it’s focus lock and then the main camera will begin focusing properly again. This is what I attempt most of the time – and sometimes it works but not consistently.\nI also force quit the camera app and clear the camera app’s cache. This has had inconsistent results as well. I’ve also tried wiping all data associated with the camera app – again with varied results in correcting the main camera focus issues. Most of the time I tend to just ‘miss the moment’ I was trying to capture, or if I’m really in a time crunch, find a way to make it work with either the ultra-wide or 3x lens.\n Anyone else experiencing this issue with the main camera? Anyone have any more reliable steps for correcting the issue when it occurs?",

If I am listening to music or a podcast it continues to work fine with no issues. Only phone calls are causing this issue.\nI have done the following:\nRestarted the phone.\nToggled Bluetooth off/on.\nUnpaired Bluetooth and then re-paired it.\nCleared Android Auto Data and Cache. Then set up AA again.\nCleared Bluetooth System Protocol Data and Cache.\nReset Network Settings.\nTurned off Bluetooth scanning in location settings.\nChecked in developer settings to see if any settings might help - couldn't see anything relevant.\nWhat I have not done, and would like to avoid if possible, is a factory reset of the handset.

My Outlook work email and my personal Hotmail accounts didn't transfer.\nWhen I try to sign into my Outlook work email, it first takes me to the login username page that looks like I'm signing into a Gmail account then tells me that my password is incorrect. The password is correct, I use an online password keeper, and have been able to sign-on through a browser on my laptop to verify. I have tried logging into my Outlook email account by adding the account in Settings, through the Outlook app even after uninstalling and reinstalling as well, and through the Calendar app. I've set the account as Outlook Exchange, Office 365, Other, etc. Each path yields the same results.\nWhen I tried to sign into my personal Hotmail account via the Outlook app, it took to me to the familiar Microsoft sign-on and I was able to sign-on with no issue.\nHas anyone else ran into this issue? The last time I switched phones (S5 to S9), all accounts switched seamlessly.\n(Cross posted on Microsoft forums)",

      "text": "So I've had MANY Samsung devices in my day. It's a bit of a love/hate relationship with the brand. Sometimes there are hits and other times there are straight up misses.\nI bought a S20 Ultra in 2020 and the camera glass cracked, developed a hole, and condensation eventually killed the device. Instead of paying the insane price of repair, I was so dissatisfied with performance of the camera in that $1400 device, I chalked it up to a paperweight and got a Pixel 3a XL. When I tell you that the $350 Pixel produce more consistent and better quality photos than my Galaxy S20 Ultra, I mean it. So I rocked the 3a XL for about a year until the S21 was announced. While the camera performance was spectacular, the device was slow and annoying. So, instead of going all in like I did the Ultra, I decided to get a S21 5G instead. \n\nWhile the 120Hz OLED is beautiful, performance is mega, and the hardware is gorgeous, the camera generally disappoints. The images are inexplicably blurry, the shutter speed snaps photos much later after you press the shutter button, and zooming in on photos only shows graininess and lack of sharpness. And don't get me started on the selfie camera. It still tries to \"beautify\" my face, even with the effects and filters turned off.\n\nI thought I was misremembering my experience on my Pixel, so I pulled it out for some comparison shots and turns out, I wasn't. The photos from the Pixel 3a XL were much more pleasing out of auto-mode than on my S21 5G. Not just sorta better, but NOTICIBLY better. I was also more easily able to whip my phone out of my pocket, take a shot, and assume it was fine, than immediate reviewing it on my Galaxy to see if I needed to take it again, and maybe again, to finally get a usable shot.\n\nIt is frustrating listening to the marketing hype and show that Samsung puts on every year only to be outperformed by a $350 device in this area ESPECIALLY since Samsung likes to use marketing photos that are seemingly DSLR-like quality.\n\nThat's all to say, what am I doing wrong with my S21 in auto-mode to make the photos experience so challenged?",

When I switch to the other ear the volume drops drastically. Has anyone else noticed this?\n\nComparing how the S21 is built vs S9 , the speaker on the S21 is on top right edge of phone vs the top mid front facing for the S9. When I hold to my left ear the speaker lay in scapha or above the helix of the ear.\n\nAnytime I want to multi-task on a phone call and use my dominant hand for something else I have adjust the phone to an uncomfortable position. \n\nYou can't fix my phone but Samsung please reevaluate the speaker position for your next generation.

As a matter of fact, all my friends are using iPhones, and I am the only one still using a Galaxy phone.\nAbout two weeks ago, I replaced phone screen of my S21 under factory warranty at UBREAKIFIX #688 - Carmel Mountain Ranch. Later I found out that the technician left some fingerprints inside the camera sensor, and I was not able to clean it from outside.\nSince I do not have tools to open the cellphone back cover, I went to their store again and ask them to clean the fingerprints for me. The store staff refused to admit the fingerprints were left by their technician, and instead would charge me for the cleaning labor. When I refused to pay the amount she demanded, she asked me to leave the store.\nThe cost of cleaning was not the issue. If the staff at least admits their mistake and gives an apology, I actually don't mind paying the labor since I understand it will not be covered by warranty. However the store staff was rude and keeps implying I opened the cellphone up myself and left fingerprints on camera sensor. When I showed her how photos are cloudy and blurry from the camera now, she acted like it was no big deal, even it was their technitian who left the fingerprints there.\nWorst repairing experience ever had.

The auto convert seems to work when sharing an image to msging or chat apps but when I share to the native Gmail app they are attached as HEIF files and not JPG images. To me that seems to be a bug. If I'm emailing pics to someone without HEIC/HEIF capabilities then there are too many extra steps to convert and attach JPG images to an email. I'm hoping this can be addressed as a fix in a future update.  Can anyone else confirm the same issue? ",

I see that for some reason, a good amount of people seem to be requesting the opposite of what I want to be a feature on One UI for the S21 series. Coming from iOS, I am used to my phone screen waking briefly when I receive a notification, as this is a default setting. \nTo me, this is an awesome feature because it allows me to quickly look at my screen, without having to interact with it, and see what notification I just received. Because of my job, I always keep my phone on vibrate only and it doesn't make sense to switch back and forth so it can ring after work hours, since I may forget to switch back to vibrate and my phone might start going off while I'm in an important call or meeting. \nI also have a Galaxy Watch 3, and I was surprised to see that in the settings, there is an included option to \"turn on the watch screen when  Notifications are received.\" This only helps me when I am wearing the watch so when I don't have it on, I have to constantly check to see if I missed any notifications. If the phone is near me, I sometimes don't hear/feel it vibrate, but I'd the screen turns on, it immediately gets my attention. \nTo note, I mostly use Whatsapp for messaging and to my knowledge, the Messages app is the only one that wakes the screen when messages come in. \nIf this setting can be enabled for the watch and for messages, why not have it as an option for the phone itself? \nIt is clear that Samsung is trying to capture a portion of the iOS market and it will only help them more to have some features that people coming from iOS are accustomed to. Even if it is only enabled in vibrate mode, that would already be huge for people that are used to having this feature on their iOS devices.",

      "text": "I've been a Samsung Brand Loyalist since way back when Samsung TVs overtook the Sony Trinitron line of TVs as best in class and consumer purchase numbers. I'm not completely certain what the original appeal was beyond that or why the likes of LG or other equivalent brands of the day got no love from me back then. Fast forward to today, and I know exactly why. The second Samsung Galaxy smart phone I owned was the Galaxy S5, and that phone was a large part of why Samsung earned my loyalty. But the relationship would not be completely solidified until the company severely <edit> in the design of that iterations replacement. \n  When the Galaxy S6 line was released, I was beside myself with frustration, confusion, and basically severe disappointment. While the new S6 designs were the impitus of those negative reactions, the focus of my ire was squarely on the company itself for basically designing out the very features that compelled me to purchase the S5 in the first place. They decided to eliminate the removable/ replaceable battery back when carrying around an extra fully charged battery for your phone was commonplace. They decided to eliminate the ¼\" headset jack, doing so before quality Bluetooth headsets were hardly affordable and Bluetooth LE wasn't even a thing. And then they decided to eliminate the MicroSD card dock way before the concept of reliable cloud storage was anywhere near as widespread as it needed to be. \n  There were more features that were curtailed and/ or eliminated in the S6 series, but these were the three that I found to represent the common underlying offense which lead to Samsung choosing to make these changes, an error that is far too commonly committed by manufacturers and service providers across the economy. Samsung simply chose that the S6 series was going to be the pivot point where they would abandon the needs and desires of their core global customer base, and instead of offering hardware that met the needs of this customer base, they would now begin to mimick the designs of their most challenging industry competitor, the iPhone. The Samsung Galaxy mobile hardware division simply lost its way and tried to be something they were not, and which their customers didn't want them to be.\n  Life's most valuable lessons are almost always delivered in the most painful experiences possible. There isn't a company in existence that hasn't dropped the ball in some way or fashion. It's actually a healthy process to go through for most, assuming the after action review of the failure is analyzed and corrective actions are taken. As is the case with individuals and companies alike, there is no greater catalyst for improvement or the gaining of knowledge then that which results from a complete and total failure. It's all about how that failure is handled and leveraged.\n  Once the anemic S6 features, or lack there of, were released and those like me who had been excited to upgrade but quickly became resigned to keeping the older phones we had, it wasn't long before the magnitude of the design failures started to become clear to Samsung leadership. I was only one of probably millions of disappointed people who were ready to buy the new S6, but decided not to. While I'll never know how many were compelled to voice our frustrations directly to the company via a very terse, yet well crafted email, I'm willing to bet it was a whole lotta people. \n  We were Samsung customers for many reasons, one of the most significant being that Samsung was NOT iPhone. We chose Samsung because they didn't try to push it's customers into recent innovations in technology which were both excessivly priced and still unproven, something iPhone is always doing. We chose Samsung because they offered phones that were designed with utility and user customizable features that empowered us to make the phone work best for our specific needs, not a one size fits all mantra like iPhone. So what on Earth compelled Samsung to try and be the very company they were valued as not being? \n  My loyalty was cemented a year later when Samsung released the next iteration of the Galaxy line, the S7 series. It was one of the first times I had been watching closely enough to see what it looked like when a multinational corporation chooses to listen to it's customers' collective needs, and I was beyond impressed. They didn't bring back everything, removable batteries were never going to remain mainstream, especially as the technology becomes more and more capable with each iteration. But sure enough, they heard us, they listened to what we were saying, and they reversed course with the vast majority of features. The fact that I would quickly grow to despise my S7 Edge on account of the Edge feature, Samsung was back on track!\n  After beating <edit> the S7 everyday in my steering wheel everyday when the stupid Edge screen would come into contact with a part of my hand and erroneously do things to enrage me, I knew I would never purchase another phone with that utterly worthless gimmicky feature. The problem was, they decided to make that Edge thing a standard design feature with all of the following year's S8 series phones, much to my dismay. But patience paid dividends for me when I read about the mid-cycle release of the S8 Active model. \n  I had never really looked at the Active versions of the older iterations, and I'm not even sure I was aware of them. But this S8 Active had everything I could want, a bigger battery, no stupid Edge screen, and something I wouldn't realize about the phone until I had it for a few weeks. One of the many reasons I'm never going to own an iPhone as a primary cell phone is an experience I had with an older iPhone 5. I don't remember why I had it, but I do remember accidentally dropping onto a hardwood floor from a height no greater than 2½ feet up. From my perspective watching the phone drop in slow motion, I still am amazed at how the moment the frame came into contact with the floor, the screen didn't just crack. No, the screen seemed to enthusiastically explode out as though it had been waiting to do so it's entire life, and in an instant, the iPhone went from useful to useless. Done. \n  I've dropped plenty of Samsung Galaxy phones throughout my life, all from differing heights, some faring better then others, but none exploding in glee like that iPhone. That said, the durability of that S8 Active was ridiculously high, and trust me when I say this, I tested that thing on more than once occasion. In at least one bout of ginger rage triggered by the phone not functioning how I wanted it to, it survived without a scratch after being overhand day pitched into a wall about 6 feet away, the sheetrock suffering all that damage (I've since repaired it because it wasn't the sheetrock's fault!). \n  I would be compelled to maintain that S8 Active for years beyond it's dated technology because Samsung, for whatever reason, decided to do away with all Active variants in any Galaxy iterations that would come after the S8. Why, why do you do these things Samsung? The S21 Ultra is a beast which almost has the feel of an Active model once tucked into the Spigen case I use for all my phones. But I bet there is plenty of demand for an S21 Active if you made one. No, the corporate rugged XCover model that sorta looks like an Active doesn't rate. My <edit> 3 year old S8 Active had a more powerful processor and better features than that underdeveloped model offered. I want all the Gucci hotness you guys stuffed into this ridiculously capable S21 Ultra offered in a <edit> housing that can easily shrug off an occasional overhand fast pitch into a wall because I know you guys can build it. If you do this and relaunch the Active models, I'll be a Samsung customer for life. If you don't do it, I'll still be a Samsung customer for life, so I'm really not in a position to negotiate. Do it to make the exploding iPhones screens look even more stupid!",

I just purchased the S21 Ultra, and was shocked to find out that it does not have the capability to create and add an automatic signature to outgoing text messages!  Whose idea was it to eliminate that function?  Ouch! That is a critical feature in my line of work, and something that I would also consider to be a primary \"common sense feature\" even for more casual users.  How many times have you wondered who sent you a message, because you don't recognize the number?  That happens all the time!  I found out that Verizon has Message+ that would allow me to add a signature.  That isn't an ideal alternative, though, for reasons I won't go into now.  Besides ...  doesn't it seem ridiculous to spend this kind of money on a device and then hope you can find an app somewhere just so you can add a function that should be considered a basic essential of the device?  Sorry to go on so long, but I wanted to be sure there are strong reasons for this request.  Everyone I have mentioned this to is shocked to learn that the device can't do that.  Can you PLEASE get that function added as an update to the S21 Ultra ASAP.  You had it on your previous devices, so the process should be rather quick.  Thank you! \nNOTE: I would like to make some suggestions on a couple of changes to the text message signature function when you add it. \n1) Previously it had about 30 characters available. I would suggest making it at least 60. \n2) Since many people need to use their device for personal use AND for work, I suggest creating a \"toggle\" that gives the user the opportunity to choose between 2 different signatures when they send a message.  That one might be more complicated and take more time to develop.  If so, I would suggest rolling out the first change right away while this one is being developed.",

That may come as some relief to those who suffered through my anger and frustration in earlier posts. As a token of my appreciation to you all for putting up with me, I am glad to share what I learned.\nIt certainly could be possible that your fingerprint sensor is, in fact, defective. This is, after all, a new phone in its first months of production. But you should try these steps first, before making a visit to Ubreak.\nYou should watch a few videos of people who really know how to work with the fingerprint sensor successfully. Watch how they register their fingers; watch how they use the sensor to actually sign in. That was my big \"Aha\" moment. So that's the way you're supposed to hold your finger! That's the way you're supposed to press on the sensor! Who knew?\nAnd on the subject of your finger: Don't use your finger - use your thumb. You're giving the sensor more skin to read.\nOnce you have successfully registered your thumb(s) or your finger(s) don't stop there. Go ahead and practice unlocking your phone with the fingerprint sensor. Do it several times. The more often you do this (up to a point, probably) the faster the sensor recognizes your thumb/finger.\nNow that you're getting the hang of it, watch a video from a Fingerprint Master, like \"Jimmy is Promo\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9v3H1dOyQc to learn secrets for making the fingerprint sensor work faster. This stuff really works.\nAt last, I have unlocked the secrets of the Galaxy S21 fingerprint sensor! Now, instead of using my middle finger to talk to my phone, I use my thumbs to unlock it.",

It keeps telling me that either I didn't verify my email address when I signed up (I'm getting email replies when someone posts), or something else I can't remember. So here we go.\nThe Moderator was likely blaming my WiFi router, and telling me I'd probably need to buy an amp ($400 for a good one), or buy a newer router.  I'm not about to do that after spending money on an expensive S21+.  I shouldn't need to. According to US Cellular's maps, I'm in a strong signal area and should even get 5G. Nope. Never seen the 5G icon at my home. And someone I see \"No Cellular Service\". \nMy Asus AC66R is fully updated to the latest firmware and put's out a strong -35dBm signal. And I also have repeaters in the house where I need them. Oh, and I work at a large company that has about 1000 repeaters that are less than a year old, plus a state-of-the-art WiFi system in the building. My WiFI Calling turns itself off there too. There's several repeaters just in the lab I work in. \nFurther, he stated that WiFi Calling is a Carrier specific function and so it has to be a carrier problem, not a phone problem. NOT !  WiFi Calling \"ability\" is carrier specific. The \"function\" of being able to turn it on or off IS WITHIN THE PHONE'S SOFTWARE. The carrier has no ability to turn my WiFi Calling switch on or off. Strike two from Samsung Support.\nLast night while trying to turn it on, it kept asking me for my 911 info which I'd already put in a few days back. Every time I'd press on ACCEPT, it would loop back and ask me to put it in again ... over and over and over. It would never turn on the WiFi Calling then. That smells to me like a software issue.  But I'll admit, it could be a hardware issue too. \nI just got off the phone with US Cellular's technicians, and heard two very interesting things:\n1. The problem with WiFi Calling does not happen with ANY other brand of phone they sell ... only Samsung. He rattled off about 6 other brands they sell ... no WiFi Calling issues with any of them. Only Samsung. It is a known issue that they have talked to Samsung about many times according to this technician. \n2. The weak signal receive that is making me need to use WiFi Calling (never had to before with any other phone I used including a Samsung S8+) is ALSO a known problem with the S21 phones. They've also talked to Samsung about this.\nI wish I'd known all of this prior to buying a Samsung S21+.  And the other mistake I made was buying the phone directly from Samsung,  having to deal with support staff there that don't know what they're talking about, and shipping phones back and forth.\nOh ... I'm an RF Engineering Technician for a large Aerospace company. I don't know much about cell phones. But I do understand software and RF signals. ",

I checked my SIM card port and it like no liquid got inside and there was no pink colored strip inside either. It looked dry so I also checked by putting my charger in through the USBC port. My phone got a notification that moisture was detected so I removed the charger immediately. I then blew some air into the USBC port and speaker. Used a q-tip to swab everything inside the USBC port. I put the charger back in and there was no notification of moisture. However, I am worried that because Mountain Dew is very caustic will it cause any future damage if there are still bits of it inside, particularly the SIM port, USBC port, and bottom right speaker? I was checking what to do in the support page and it said to rinse out the USBC port with water. Can I just use my faucet's tap water to rinse it out and let it dry?",

I've also been purchasing music through iTunes for years, under the MPEG-4 (.m4a) audio format. These songs played just fine on my S8 and S10.\nI recently upgraded to the S21 and used Smart Switch to transfer all of my music from the S10 to the S21. All of my old music plays normally. However, any music that was purchased (via iTunes) after I started using my S21 has issues with the audio cutting out and sounding very static-y about 30% of the time I select them with my Buds on. If I start playing the song on the speaker and then connect my Buds, audio cutting always follows. After clicking the song a few times, the song plays normally. However, these newly purchased songs are totally unplayable using Android Auto, as the audio cuts out every single time I select them.\nI have re-installed the Samsung Music app and re-downloaded the songs with audio issues from iTunes multiple times, to no avail. How do I fix this? I assume nothing has changed in the way iTunes encodes their audio files since I got the S21, this happens over bluetooth and the speaker (therefore bluetooth isn't the issue), and all my old purchases play without any issues.

Multi-tasking with anything else on the phone while casting media to the TV seems to be working fine - e.g. texting works & notifications pop-up on the phone even while casting media via youtube, SmartThings (Screen Mirroring) or Google Home.\nSo what is going on here? I went through most of the settings and did a little light google searching but was unable to fix this issue. I mean, like, shouldn't phone calls work while casting? I was pretty certain that there would be a notification popup on the phone/TV when receiving a call - especially if you can't talk on the phone while casting, but apparently I was wrong?\nI could have sworn that my iPhone (brother got it for me don't ask lol it's actually a decent phone ... but that's a whole different story that we just won't get into :D) was able to send and receive phone calls when casting ... or it would at least give me a notification so I know.\nAnyways, what am I doing wrong?\nAny advice on how to troubleshoot this?\nAssume I'm not a complete newbie and have done the more basic things already.\nEither way, any help is appreciated for the simple fact that time was taken to read/reply, :).\nA few things:\n- The phone can send and receive calls when it is not casting.\n- The devices in question include both Samsung devices: Samsung's Galaxy & Tizen Smart TV.\n If it turns out that this is something that is well known and phones simply are not able to send/receive calls while casting to another device then ... well... dang.\nI just assumed that such a possibility is incredibly unlikely in this day and age ... but I do always say assuming can be dangerous... 😞",

I was told that, once the new phone was delivered and the return received, that I would get a credit on my account for the return and the coupon, and that I should reach out to them to get that done.  So I ordered a second phone, and initiated a return for the old one.  Went through set up and transfer of apps and such again, pairing with all my gadgets, etc.,. \nToday I get an email saying that my trade-in had been processed and that the phone was being returned to me.  When I went to chat support to inquire, they told me that they could do nothing, and that the thing to do would be to return my phone and order a THIRD phone, using my trade-in phone to get the credit. \nWhat sort of stupidity is this?

As soon as I unplug the jack adapter it goes back to fast charging. I tested my phone out with other Qi chargers that support 10W fast charging with and without the jack adapter and I get the same results. I then tried plugging in a normal USB-C cable (not connected to any power source) and the wireless fast charging worked fine. Therefore, the problem must be with USB-C to 3.5mm jack adapter.

(1) went in to settings and turned if background services on EVERY application that was not essential, excluding  Email, LinkedIn, etc. and (2) went in to settings and told every app to close when not in use.\nPrior to doing thus the phone ran hot during \"normal use\" and after the wireless carrier and Samsung support suggested running it for 2 days without 5G. My response to them was \"seriously, you want me to turn off the 5G functionality that was the reason I bought the S21.\nBy limiting  background services and closing applications when not in use,, my battery life is acceptable, but many believe the 5G radio draws more power than 4G, but that is yet to be confirmed.",

I first started calling about 10 days after my order as it has been shown under the status from day one as \"expedited\". I spoke with a rep and they said because I ordered titanium that it would be longer since it was a special order. I was seriously unhappy with that response since NO WHERE on the site or within ordering process did it say that special color schemes (or the like) would take longer to process being a special order.\n\nThey couldn't give me a timeline, only that it's *expedited* in the shipping process order status. The add-ons were free but they have a ship date of March 31, but it doesn't say that the phone itself will be shipped on that date. Is the wording to upkeep hope that the phone will come sooner and the rest at the later date or that is the overall actual date of the phone shipment but they don't want to ward off buyers for taking so long? Who knows (I'll admit I wouldn't wait because the point of getting the newest release is that one gets it relatively close to that release date).\n\nAnyway, I tried to cancel three times and after the third time when a rep said it could be done, I received an email saying that due to manufacturing process it has to remain in the system, that I can just reject it when it gets shipped to me (this was said by the first two phone reps). Seriously, that is how one cancels an order, like they're making it appear that it's a carved in stone process. This is yet another way to get the customer to just take the phone upon arrival. So, I ask if I order a black phone how long that would take, they said about 2 weeks. But after reading how some here are waiting a month for just that color scheme, I am totally put off .\n Here's the real kicker; just got an email today (February 19) that my order is now delayed (remember what I said about March 31) and that my phone will ship no later than April 7 (or before). So this kind of confirms that my order wasn't going to ship until March 31 along with the add-ons. Just WOW, two and a half months after ordering this device will I get it. Darn, that will be pushing into the next Samsung releases of phones!\n tl;dr\n Ordered S21 Ultra Titanium on Jan 27, got email saying that it won't be shipped until no later than April 7, that's about 2.5 months! :grimacing_face:\n Edit update: having a online chat abt the delay the rep abruptly ended that chat. Now trying to get back has an even longer wait. This is customer service for you. I am just going to reject the phone when it arrives. Not taking a phone that's near halfway though a release cycle to the next release in August.\n ",

I DON'T HAVE A MODEM because I use public Hotspot. sorry for yelling, my blood pressure rises thinking about this. anyway tech says factory data reset (I knew better), but I did it anyway, then it gets worse, lost contacts, important apps from my employer, important vm's, because my ringer refused to operate even, volume was erratically adjusting itself hi low hi low anytime I attempt blue tooth connection, then my messaging app would race my pandora app upon blue tooth connecting as well I would win that by fighting both apps but still my messaging app would stay on simultaneously with pandora. my s21+ I got brand new unopened $1k on payment plan. Verizon said too late for warranty is only good for 14 days after purchase. keep telling these people my issues began on day one and on day three I finally had time to call support the first time. the store I bought it from (go wireless), tried very hard to help fix it but they only knew what settings to check but they were all correctly set. magically they were able to get my ringer to work and called me a couple times while I was there to test. after I get home, my ringer magically would not work once again. since Verizon was trying to rip me off by telling me they can only replace the s21+ under their 14 day warranty with a certified pre-owned s21+ but at that time, it was beyond the 14 day warranty period. I so I got high blood pressure and said NOPE I will be receiving a brand new phone because that's what I am paying for, I did not purchase a pre-owned anything, so let me talk to whoever is in charge of making that happen. team leader put me on hold until his management went home for the day, he checked couple times to see if I was still holding (better believe I was), last time he asked I told him I'm calling Samsung direct then he tried arguing with me as I hung up. Samsung warranty is good for up to one year as is typical for anything aside from landscaping. well they want me to send my phone away with me paying postage and having no other phone, but they will fix it when it arrives in Texas?? why can I not just get a replacement from the store I purchased it from?? Samsung answer because it's most likely a software issue, if it is then it has to go to Google because they are the one's who developed the software. <edit> anybody have any clue how to fix this?? I'm thinking a 20lb. sledge, torch maybe, brick and the river?? but then I'm out $1k for a phone that never worked right out of the box. ",

ATT claims data received from Samsung omitted this device. Samsung claims that unlock codes were provided at time of manufacturer and the issue is with ATT. While I was on the phone with advanced ATT support, they called Samsung support to request an unlock code per CTIA guidance. That request was denied. \n\nIn researching this issue online, it appears to be a common problem with carrier locked devices sold by Samsung.com. I have spoken now to 9 support people at ATT over 3 days. They physically cannot unlock this device without data sharing from Samsung. Meanwhile, Samsung CS pins the blame on ATT. I purchased this device at retail and it is under warranty. ATT agrees that it is eligible for unlock and are willing to unlock the device but cannot without updated data from Samsung. As a customer, I have been caught in the middle. I have sent details via Twitter messenger to Samsung Mobile US with no reply. I have spent hours on the phone with Samsung CS without being offered any solution, only finger pointing. I have provided enough detail for Samsung engineering to work with ATT to provide data necessary for a carrier unlock code for this device. \n\nIf I RMA the device back to Samsung, I will be out a phone and will be forced to waste half a day to set up a new device with no guarantee that it won't have the same issue. There is clearly a communication problem and/or inconsistent policy between Samsung and ATT. I have also read similar accounts with other carriers. IMO, there should be an option to purchase a carrier variant which is unlocked from the factory. There is zero reason for these devices to be locked since they are purchased at retail and not subject to ATT payment plan or other ATT subsidized pricing dependent on service contracts. The unbranded US factory unlocked variant of this device likely does not support ATT features such as HD Voice, Call Protect, wifi calling, etc. \n\nSimply because the IMEI of this device appears in the Samsung internal database does not mean that it appears in ATT's unlock code database. I see this as a database management and data sharing glitch that potentially impacts thousands of customers. Most will not realize that they have purchased a device incapable of unlock until their Samsung warranty has expired.\n\nPlease do not suggest that I contact ATT customer support which I have exhausted in spades. I am asking Samsung to contact ATT and provide a joint solution. This should happen seamlessly without involving the customer. I feel like I have been dragged into a bad marriage.",

When you go to gallery or take a screenshot of something and want to send it to a contact, the next step shows the screen with \"messages, email, Messenger, Viber\" etc. Then you have to click on messages and pick who you want to send it to. However, under my husband's screen once you select the picture you're sending, the next screen shows the latest contacts you recently sent something to, making the process a little faster. Ideas?\nThanks! ",

Updates to some of applications installed from the Google Play later appeared in the Galaxy Store. So now some apps are controlled by both Google Play and the Galaxy Store. Should it be so, or is it better to uninstall the application from Google Play and reinstall it from the Galaxy Store? Or maybe it's better to have apps controlled by both stores? And the store to which the update arrives first will install it sooner?\nBest\nMatt",

The main thing here is comparing it to Facebook Messenger; while if I'm having a prolonged conversation, I'll keep the chathead up. However, often times I'm just replying quickly and will dismiss it immediately. \n\nThe problem here is that Messenger remembers where the chathead was before dismissal and will default to that location when the chathead comes back up after being dismissed. Unfortunately, One UI 3.1's chathead function will always come up on the left of the screen, which is difficult for a righty like myself.\n\nMy only other gripe is that I really LOVE the pop up conversation here. It's great to be able to reply, see previous messages and go over the previous character limit without needing to open the app entirely. I just wish we had that functionality without chatheads. Seeing somthing similar to iOS would be ideal; a quick reply through a button via the notification banner that brings up the same interphase introduced with these systemwide chatheads.",

Mobile data works perfectly, but on wifi I have to be right next to the router to get anything over 2 mbps consistently. \n\nHere's what I've tried: \nReset network settings\nBoot into safe mode (issue persists in safe mode)\nFactory reset phone and opted out of smart switch after reset\nTurned off 5g\nTried with/without bluetooth\nTurned off Google Location Accuracy Restarted router\nChanged router frequency channel\nReset router to default ssttings\nChanged MAC address to phone MAC\n\nI do not see any messages like \"Connected Without Internet\". The connection just says \"Connected\". Very occasionally some apps will cause a message along the lines of \"WiFi unstable, waiting for stable wifi before continuing\"\n\nEvery other device in the home connects just fine, including my previous phone s7 edge. On my s7 edge, I can be on the complete other side of the house and still get reasonable speeds. \n\nWhen enabling mobile data tethering on another device, I can connect to that device's hotspot with a reasonable speed.\n\nWhen checking the speed directly next to the router, I see good speeds, as expected with any device right next to a router. A couple feet or more away from the router, and the speeds are abyssmal as described. It seems the WiFi range on my device has huge exponential drop-off after a couple feet.\n\nMy router is single-band (2.4GHz only). The model is MI424WR rev 1.0. I pay for 100 mbps, my s7 edge gets around 25 mbps consistently, but the s21 ultra gets around 1mbps on average, and very commonly even less than that.\n\nDue to COVID I will likely not be able to test my device on anyone else's router but my own anytime soon.\n\nIs it safe to say the device is defective? Do you recommend I RMA this device? Anyone else with similar issues have advice? Sure one can argue I have an \"older\" router but I would expect this device to at least match the network performance of my S7 edge. It does not make sense to me to say this is an issue with the router.\n\nI have submitted an error report through Samsung Members, just thought I'd post here as well to get more community feedback and discussion going.",

I know there are lots of posts about smart switch but most of them discuss capabilities more so than process.  These are process questions (mostly). I will be using it to migrate from my S9 to a new S21.\n Is it better to run smart switch during setup of the new phone or completely setup the new phone (including Google account, Samsung account, and updates) before running smart switch?\nRelated to the previous question, I have read that there is already a system update for the S21. It is carrier dependent? I.e. do I need to insert my carrier (T-Mobile) SIM for it to download the system update? (I know there are separate T-Mobile updates that get provisioned when you insert then SIM. I ordered an unlocked/non-carrier phone).\nIs it better to manually install the apps on the new phone and use smart switch to migrate data, or let smart switch do it all?\nCan I expect smart switch to successfully migrate app logins, or will I have to re-enter them?\nWhen is it best to move the SIM card to the new phone? Before or after running smart switch?\nFinally, USB or wireless data transfer? Given both phones are USB 3.x, USB should be faster right? Current smart switch documentation shows using a USB A-C cable with a C-to-A adapter connected to the new phone. Does it work equally well with the C-C cable (and no adapter) that comes with the S21\nThanks!",
