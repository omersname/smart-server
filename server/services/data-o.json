CarPlay functions fully except for ONE THING: whenever I use the button on my steering wheel to have Siri place a call, Siri will say “ok calling….” And then nothing comes out of the speakers. The recipient of my call says they answer the call and it’s just static. Now, if I place the call manually either through my phone or by pressing the buttons on my radio, it goes through just fine. But using the dictation feature through the steering wheel causes a glitch I guess? It just won’t come through the speakers. I have reset my car infotainment system to factory, I have reset all CarPlay settings on my phone. Nothing works so far. The problem is the update. My phone/CarPlay has functioned through all the updates until the 15 version. I can receive calls. I can make calls manually but I can’t use the button on the steering wheel to make a call. Now that defeats the purpose of handsfree doesn’t it? Something was changed during the update or something caused a glitch. Anyone else having this issue? ",

This is obviously a huge issue because people have been posting videos and “fixes” on the web, but none of these things are solutions. Why is this so hard? Besides the fact that it should not do this to begin with (if I want to play music, I will!) There should just be a button or something to tap to turn this incredibly annoying “feature” OFF! Not some trickery deep in settings that have nothing to do with iTunes that don’t work anyway.

The software had been trouble free for me until I had to move back to India.\nMy carrier in India is Airtel which has good LTE coverage in my hometown. It supports VoLTE and WiFi calling as well.

But, since I was already enrolled into One UI 4 beta, I got upgraded to the beta version again and VoLTE and WiFi calling stopped working. Interestingly, I used my Mint mobile sim card which I used in US and VoLTE and WiFi calling work with this card.\nI contacted @USBetaModerator and he deregistered me from One UI 4 beta. I was able to downgrade to OneUI 3.1 again using Smart Switch. I was so relieved seeing VoLTE and WiFi calling working again.\nToday, One UI 4 stable version was rolled out. I upgraded to this G998U1UEU4BUK7 version. To my frustration, VoLTE and WiFi calling stopped working again. This means that anyone who has a Samsung S21 series phone (or maybe any Samsung phone) with OneUI 4 will have the same problem. You won't be able to use it outside US.\nI am assuming the network auto switch feature which Samsung introduced with One UI 4 is causing this issue. I had been trying to get some help from the Samsung team, but none has been able to help so far.\n@sr14 is another user who is facing the exact same issue. \n@USBetaModerator @Samsungteam If you have a solution for this issue, let us know. Or at least advise the customers who plan to use their phones outside US not to upgrade to One UI 4.\nAttaching the screenshots for everyone's reference. As you can see, in One UI 4, \"IMS Registration\" status is shown as \"Not Registered\" and \"Voice over LTE\" toggle is \"OFF\". In One UI 3.1, \"IMS Registration\" status is \"Registered\" and \"Voice over LTE\" toggle is \"ON\".\nUsers outside US: Please don't install OneUI 4 until this issue is fixed.\nThanks,\nAPS\nOneUI 3.1 (VoLTE toggle is ON)\nOneUI 3.1 (IMS Registered)\nOneUI 4.0 (VoLTE toggle is OFF)\nOneUI 4.0 (IMS Not Registered)",

I've had it on its original charger for hours so I'm sure its fully charged.\nI purchased right out from Best Buy and they told me today that i will have to take it to one of their locations who are certified Samsung dealers. This is a bummer because this is the 2nd Samsung to do this and all i want to know is why? Another weird thing that happened is this: When i first purchased it, it got so hot it scared me so much that i called Samsung from my other phone to report it. I was told that was not a known issue but if it continues, they can have me drop it off at some location to take a look. Sorry for the long post but I tried to offer up as much information as possible. Feedback needed..thanks",

    "So I am going to do my best to explain this, but when I type a new text to someone, the first word of the text will automatically be changed to the last word I sent in a text whether it is from the same person or a different person. For example, I typed \"would you have some?\" to my husband and then went to text my brother \"did you not see that movie?\" and it changed the \"did\" in the second text to \"some?\" so now the text to my brother says \"some? you not see that movie?\" I am not sure if this is an auto-correct thing or what but does anyone have any suggestions as to how to make this stop? I don't want to turn auto-correct off completely because I do have sausage fingers and make errors while typing so I do like the feature, but when I try to explore the settings I have no idea what to search for in order to stop this weird autofill in the text messages thing from happening. Any advice or suggestions?",

    "Just recently, since the last major firmware upgrade, my Samsung Galaxy s21 has recieved the same images through text, multiple times through out the day.

This happens both over known good wifi, and cellular data. I am with ATT if it makes a difference. Sometimes it happens once a day, sometimes it happens 5 times a day. I tried deleting the pictures but it doesn't help. I am about ready to throw the phone in the garbage.

    "On December 23rd 2021, I regret to say that I fell into the trap of buying a new Samsung Galaxy s21 under Samsung's Trade-in program. They offered $500 of bonus credit and $55 when I sent in my perfectly working Samsung Galaxy s9.\nNow I have been a Samsung customer for a long time - s5, s6, s7, s9 and now the s21. I have never disliked Samsung, in fact I always supported the brand. Until now.\nShortly after sending in my phone, I received an email from Asurion (Samsung's super scammy 3rd party who handles trade-ins) saying they'll be charging my bank card because I never sent it in.\nI knew I had sent it, so I ignored it.\nA few days later, I get another email from Asurion saying that I *Did* send it in, but it wasn't in a good enough condition, so they'll be charging me $100. Which is of course $45 MORE than the rebate they offered in the first place.\nI offer an email rebuttal and ask for a photo. They then try to say they've changed it to $55 now, and lo and behold, a charge for $55 appears on my bank statement from Asurion.\nNow I'm not one to make a big deal out of things but this really, really, really **bleep** me off. I would never have touched the s21 if I knew I would be scammed out of my phone. I loved my s9, and in many ways it was a better phone than the s21.\nI would implore ANYONE who is reading this to not tempt fate, do NOT use the Tradeup program even if they offer you money, and DO NOT stay with Samsung because their customer service quality is so low, it's deeper than Hades.\nNo chat, call, or email support from Samsung is willing to help - they all just say \"we can't help, you have to email Asurion\". Sure mate, let me just ASK THE PEOPLE WHO STOLE MY MONEY for MY MONEY BACK. That will work.\nSo deeply disappointed in Samsung and this entire experience.",

    "The S21 line are amazing phones. So why are sales so poor?  I read with interest the following article about Samsung scratching their heads trying to figure out why:\nhttps://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/samsung-galaxy-s21-sales-poor/\nI normally upgrade to the latest S model every two years, when the latest and greatest arrives. I've done that for the S10+, S8+ and S6. But I didn't do it this year. Now it seems that I'm not the only one who has dropped the idea of upgrading.... and heres the key reason why we haven't bought the latest (when we normally would do so): \nHey, Samsung, this is a no-brainer:  you seriously DOWNGRADED the phone's storage capability by removing expandable storage (i.e., an SD card). This is the same dumb thing that Apple does. The problem is Samsung has been dumber, because they removed something that was clearly one big reason why Apple customers have jumped ship to Samsung. And why Samsung customers have stayed.\nThen Samsung insulted long-time Samsung mobile owners by not at least upgrading the base internal storage from 128 to 256 Gb to compensate for this.\nThat's two big dumb moves from Samsung. It's that sort of thing that is turning customers off. Samsung made the same dumb decision by removing expandable storage with the S6, but they got smart again and returned it to the S7.\nLet's hope Samsung gets this. Storage is a majorly huge issue when it comes to a smartphone. And the #1 reason -- by far -- that more storage is needed is photos and videos. Now we have very high resolution photos (108 megapixels) and that means far bigger photo files and 8K video, meaning WAY bigger video files. And Samsung REMOVES expandable storage? Really, Samsung?\nSamsung could argue, well photo and video taking runs so much better on internal storage. Granted. However, today's SD cards have incredible throughput. They are far more capabable than even a few years ago. Samsung has always been about consumer choice. Expandable storage is a critical choice.\nSamsung.... smell the coffee. S21 sales are down because you did dumb. Either return expandable storage in next year's lineup (very smart) or at least increase the base storage if you insist on removing expandable storage (not as smart).\nHopefully, someone at Samsung with some decision making capability is paying attention to this. it's not rocket science. Let's get that expandable storage back, Samsung!",

    "I've been with Samsung since the S3 and had the S4, note 4, S8,  S9+, S20+ and now the S21+. The note 4 had great spot in colors even with an older sensor than current phones. The S8 was the last one I had that actually took decent pictures. Starting with my s9, Samsung slowly started their saturation creep. The S20 series and S21 series pictures are just way too saturated. I don't know who in the marketing department did tests, but the pictures are too unrealistic to color in real life. We don't need overly greens, super blue skies and bright reds. The whole image in general is just too saturated. Comparing pics side by side taken with the S8, the S8 has much better pictures. The sensor is so much better on the S21, but ruined by post processing. A tad too much noise reduction making images muddy, and again, the over saturation. We shouldn't have to post process every picture.\n\nI never had an iPhone and never want one, but their camera is light years ahead. I absolutely love how their images look, and they are LIFELIKE. No need for all the extra saturation. I wish Samsung took this seriously and make the pictures look like the S8 series again. Videos are the same mess. Too much saturation. Who thinks this is okay??\n\nPro mode makes the colors look better, but usually too dark. I also can never get a sharp picture using pro mode, no matter the settings. Always fuzzy, even on lightroom. I just want a decent phone picture, out of the box like apple. And I don't even like apple. If they changed their file structure, would probably get one.\nPlease Samsung, turn down the saturation on the photos and reduce noise reduction just a little bit. ",

    "One thing I realized when using the Galaxy S21 Ultra is that it has a few delays when it comes to changes and loading within One Ui 4. What I mean by this is when you restart the phone. Usually unlocking the phone right after a restart leads to loading. This isn't a big problem, but it would make the One Ui 4 experience smoother if we didn't notice the loading. Same with changing the color palettes. When you change them, the phone delays a bit then works as normal. A suggestion I would have would be to pre-load One Ui 4 possibly during the 2nd \"Samsung Galaxy\" screen. And for the color palettes give an ongoing message letting users know that the color palette is being applied while preventing them from going to the home screen before its finish. I believe if these were implemented, One Ui 4 would become an even smoother experience for everyone.",

    "I bought my S21 in June of this year off of Samsung's website. I selected the carrier T-Mobile instead of unlocked because I was under it at the time. I recently (today on Oct 23) switched my carrier to AT&T, but when I put the AT&T SIM card in, my phone wouldn't accept it. I tried to go to the Network Unlock settings and pressed the permanent unlock, but it told me \"Your phone isn't eligible to be unlocked: reason code 132\".\nI called T-Mobile, who told me that they were unable to unlock it and that I needed to contact Samsung instead. I called Samsung, who told me that my phone was locked by T-Mobile and only they could unlock it. I ended up physically going to a T-Mobile store, and the worker called tech support in T-Mobile. They said that since I technically bought it off Samsung, T-Mobile wasn't the manufacturer and they were unable to use my IMEI to unlock my phone. \nI have been calling back and forth between the two for a couple of hours now and I still haven't gotten it fixed. I messaged both T-Mobile and Samsung on Twitter and have not yet gotten a reply. I saw that this seemed to be an issue for some people but there has never been a clear solution. Please help me.",
    "And why I was stupid, I did not check tech specs properly, just now realized that it is not having SD card slot. I do have that on my S20, so now struggling what I will do.\n Samsung should wake up! I will still not use cloud services for my pics etc, I really like more reliable way to store my pics, in SD card, no matter if phone will drop and crash, I can easily get pics, videos etc from SD card, also those that were taken 1sec before dropping my phone. Another good point from my side is that I really keep my pics, docs, videos etc in MY own devices, really not in cloud, even though I will sync my contacts, calendar etc to cloud, but that is really enough for me, if I see easy, reliable and free way to keep local backups for all those updated to my own local backups, I will get rid of those cloud services also (for contacts etc I´m just lazy and have not even studied what could be easy way to go with those, just accepted that annoyance)\n This is just unbeliveable, I did not even think it would not have SD slot when doing my preorder, but seems that some more models are banned in future on my use and will in worst case need to change my flagship manufacturer.\n ",

    "I recently purchased a Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G. \nBeing told that my new phone is Hearing Aid Compatible, I purchased Oticon More 3 minirite hearing aids. I am not profoundly deaf; I have moderate to severe hearing loss. \nI have since been told by an Oticon representative; the hearing aids are NOT compatible with my Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G.  He told me my phone was  “too high end”, and I should just wear the aids and not use the app/blue-tooth/remote benefits………what???\nHe said they are compatible with a Samsung Galaxy S21, but NOT the Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G.\nSince they are not compatible, they only work “sometimes”, with the Oticon On app.\nWhile blue-toothed to my phone, sometimes the right ear works, sometimes the left ear works, every now and then, they both work at the same time as they should.\nWhen on the phone, calls are NEVER loud enough though the aids and the Oticon On app have them turned up as high as the aids and phone will go.  When driving, I can barely hear the other person at all.  In a very quiet office setting they are adequate, if the phone is turned up as loud as possible.\nI have worked with my audiologist along with HER representative at Oticon.  I have driven back and forth to the audiologist’s office at least 8 times now (25 miles each way), I have only had the aids about three weeks. Settings have been changed, programs have been added and adjusted.  The aids are still not loud enough when on the phone and the left and right ear fade in and out whenever……\nIt was intimated that this is a Samsung problem and not an Oticon problem.  \nCan this be true?? That it’s Samsung’s problem and not Oticon’s??\nIf my phone is NOT compatible with these hearing aids now, will there EVER be a software update that WILL make them compatible with my hearing aids and if so, when should I be expecting that update?\nAs anyone knows reading this, the hearing aids are not cheap, nor is a Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G. \nWhile once excited about the prospect of a new phone and hearing aids, I am disappointed and frustrated and I feel both Samsung and Oticon have totally misrepresented their products.\nIs there ANYONE that can verify for me that my Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G is or is NOT compatible with Oticon More 3 minirite hearing aids.\nIf it is NOT compatible, can you please tell me which hearing aid brands AND models, DO work properly with this phone.\nThanks for reading and any help you can provide.",

    "My Galaxy S21 Ultra will probably be my last Samsung phone. How can you refer to something as \"ultra\" if it is missing commonly used functionality of earlier phones.\nNo SPO2 sensor? So obviously Samsung is no longer interested in supporting personal health without forcing you to buy a watch. Added an Active 2 watch to my S10+a few years ago, because it supposedly supported automated health monitoring, but they did not activate the full sensor package until the Active 3, so while it did SOME things, there were other bits of functionality that never worked (e.g. ECG). According to the app, it's not supported in my location -- Colorado. I have to keep my old S10+ around for measuring blood oxygen levels.\nNo external memory card? No, the phone cannot qualify as \"ultra\" without that.\nPricing is a game for Samsung. A week or so before Thanksgiving, I was ordering my S21 Ultra and S Pen Pro, and it showed I was going to be saving over $700! I needed to help my wife with something, and when I came back to complete and submit the order, the page refreshed and the savings dropped to about $300. Customer Service people were no help, except to say I should order it on Black Friday, as that is the best deal. I watched the prices go up higher and higher until Black Friday, and the Black Friday sale price was still more than the original quoted price. On top of that, their military discount was not \"30% through the end of the year\" as indicated in the VA newsletter. I got 2.3%, which didn't even cover taxes. That doesn't spell appreciation to us.\nThe S21 Ultra is not the only thing that failed to live up to expectations. The S Pen Pro was advertised as being flexible enough to cover multiple devices. Again, a substandard product. It works on the S21 only -- and does not even provide support for capacitive contact, therefore it won't work on other devices -- Samsung or otherwise. \nTo sum it up, Samsung has lost sight on what's important for so many people. These are not ultra devices, but diet versions of past products. The S Pen is not a \"Pro\" device if technology professionals like myself cannot use it across multiple devices. The price scam was the last straw for me. I've been recommending my friends and family compare Samsung devices to OnePlus devices, which are sold at a more reasonable price, if you don't mind sacrificing a little on camera megapixels. \nWhat a shame! Samsung started out so well. It's a shame they can't maintain it.",

    "Hi There.\nHad my S21 ultra from start of this year. \nMust say it is NOT a very good experience for about 2000 usd.\nfew month after I godt it I had problems with cell / mobile network connectivity. \nSpoke with Samsung support here in DK. Very helpfull and all. But after three factory reset I contacted their service center in DK and they got it in for repair.\nFrom the repair list they changed most of the inside of the phone. \nNow it is doing the same again. Have to different sim card in the phone. Cannot connect to mobile network. Have changed the sim card, been around my carriers store. Same problem. No connection. Putting the sim cards in my Samsung S71. No problem. And ther are the same apps on my S71 as on the S21.\nI asked Samsung support for an exchange phone and the same at Mentech (Samsung service center in DK). Samsung support said that Mentech should decide, Mentech said it has to be at the repair shop 3 (THREE) times before getting a new one.  WHAT! \nBottom line is I am NOT a very happy customer. First I have a very expensive phone that is not working as it should, second what about all the hours of work I have put in to dealing with this problem? Factory resetting( 4-5 times, as this is the holy gral of support), driving to service center, cell store, phone support and all the bad karma.  I think it add up to like 3-4 working days. Can I maybe sent Samsung the bill? \nI can see that there are more out there with that problem. \nIs there any solution to this or should I just ask to return my phone and get a refund? Thank good it is not a car.\nAnyone with good advise or having the same happy feeling about their S21? Or how to get a refund, new phone, paid for the hours that I spend. \nHave a great day out there. \nRegards kenneth...",

    "Hello I was wondering why is there such a delay on shipping the s21 Ultra? I ordered the T-Mobile s21 Ultra and silver back on September 9th and it was supposed to be delivered by October 8th and that got delayed to October 13th. Then it got delayed again and now it's just saying there's a delay and there's no date available. But what is funny is when I originally ordered it the phantom black was completely out of stock and would not let me order it but now if I go online to order the T-Mobile as 21 Ultra the phantom black is in stock and technically says it would be delivered by the end of this week if I ordered it today and the phantom silver says only available in unlocked. So is the T-Mobile one completely out of stock and I'm never going to get my phone but I've got too many discounts and trade-in offers that I used to cancel it and order it again I would end up paying double of what I paid originally. And when I called e-commerce department they just said they can expedite my order to the top of the list but I'm sure they tell everyone. My thing is they should know why there's a delay are the phone stuck on a cargo ship outside the Port of Los Angeles do they not have any physically in stock at any warehouse's or did they get like 10,000 orders and they only have like 6,000 in stock so the first 6,000 people will get it but we have to wait till they make more I mean there's got to be a legit answer. They just keep saying call e-commerce and they can update you but I have twice and they have no answers they should have all the answers. I mean they either have none manufactured or they're stuck on a boat on their way over or they just have too many orders and it's just taking longer to process them thinking they're going to get out you know a thousand a week and they only getting out like 200 so it's just taking longer than normal I mean a simple question with a simple answer. But what I want to know is why it kept giving me a new delivery date if they physically don't have them in a warehouse there should not even be an estimated delivery date their system should be able to know that so if you are giving me an estimated delivery date that means you have it in stock and it's just a matter of my order is next in queue or however you want to word it. I'm sure someone here from Samsung knows a definitive answer. Cuz this is getting frustrated my phone currently is acting up and I want to get my new one before this one gives out on me. ",

Read this all the way through before replying, as most of the things that will be suggested to me have already been considered, done, or are not available to me.\n  I bought my S21 ULTRA (Unlocked) on 03/26/2021. I was using it on Verizon for several months with no issues outside of Verizon's awful coverage in my area. Last week (08/18/2021) the phone started to randomly shut itself off after dropping cell signal. I have the same exact thing happening with my AT&T sim as well, even though I have much better signal strength. From what I could tell I was not having overheating issues (I have see that floating around as a major issue of the entire S21 lineup), with my highest core temps being around 60C (should not be an issue for modern silicon to operate at that temperature), battery never exceeding 30 or 40C.\n  I started digging around trying to find solutions on my own, here is what I tried:\nAirplane mode on then off\nReset Network Settings (Probably done this about 100 times now)\nClear Cache (Via the bootloader menu - where you power down the device then power it on while holding the volume up button w/power)\nReseating the Sim \nCleaning Sim card and Sim Tray/Slot (I have an anti-static blower made for cleaning electronics)\nFactory Reset (Both in the settings menu and in the bootloader menu)\nNothing had worked, so I finally broke down and made the drive to my nearest authorized Samsung repair center (about an hour away). They \"factory reset\" the device (at a deeper level than what the user can do through software). That seemed to have fixed the issue. My drive up there had the device losing service multiple times and restart once, had almost perfect signal the whole way back. This was 2 days ago (8/23/2021).\nYesterday the device restarted itself unprompted and started dropping signal again. This was all while being virtually right beside a cell tower for my carrier, so signal strength would not be the cause.\nToday I have been pretty much unable to use the device without being on wifi.\nI have no issues with wifi connectivity. At all. When cellular works, I get expected speeds for my area.\nI will note that I am not on the most current software for the device. I will be updating after I post this to see if Samsung issued a software patch for this issue (I am currently operating under the belief this is some software issue and not hardware).\nI haven't had any sort of overheating problems with the phone. I've seen plenty of stuff floating around about that and I haven't seen it on my device.\nI was wondering if anybody else is having this issue, and if so how many people might be affected...\nKinda defeats the purpose of a phone if it can't keep cellular connectivity!",

    "I love this phone in that the hardware is great. However, I can't justify the lack of Samsung integration with social media apps ON TOP of having an Android instead of IOS. Now that Black Friday deals are out, I think I'm going to buy a Google Pixel. The software on Samsung devices just doesn't make the cut. I'm sure it's fine for some people, but having an Android device comes with its limitations and having a Samsung device brings even more issues. I have had a Samsung phone since the Galaxy S6. Some of the things are great. A lot of the things are awful. I'm not sure why I'm posting this here. I just wanted to put it somewhere. The software is buggy at best, the lack of true Android 12 implementation is really the last straw.\nDo you know why your camera app looks absolute **bleep** on apps that didn't come with the phone? That's Samsung's fault. It's not some sort of Android quirk. Samsung doesn't allow full camera integration for any third-party apps.\nI just can't believe that I thought that all these issues were because I was usually running a phone that was a couple models old. I can't believe I spent so much money on this New device and the only benefit I've seen is the 10x zoom lense on the camera.\nI can't believe I'm still dealing with problems I had four years ago. I'm not saying that Google Pixel phones are better in hardware. Actually, it's pretty understood that they're not. But what good is all this shiny new stuff if the software hasn't kept up? I'm so tired of having to deal with all the little Samsung things. It's amazing that I have the best of the best when it comes to Android phones and for the first time ever, I'm actually questioning whether or not I should move to Apple. I don't even like iOS. So, I think I'm going to go with the Pixel 6. HALF THE PRICE of my S21 Ultra.",

    "As a hobby DSLR photographer who has two granddaughters who seem to play one sport or another 3 days a week I tend to take a lot of action shots between Softball, Field Hockey and Ice Hockey.\nI usually set my camera in Manual mode.  Set the shutter to a speed commensurate with both the sport and the lens I'm shooting with, and adjust the aperture so that I can get good isolation of the subject and then set the iso to auto to adapt to the varying lighting conditions.  I'd much rather have a photo which was a little noisy because of a high iso than one that was blurry because of too slow a shutter speed.\nWhen I bought the Ultra I was immediately disappointed with the fact that there was no auto iso in Pro Mode which meant to shoot with a fast shutter, I had to continually manually adjust the iso as the lighting conditions changed.\nI'm not sure when it happened, perhaps with Android 12, but now the iso can be set in auto or manual.\nThat means that using Pro Mode with the shutter set for my softball speed which is 1/640 using my f2.8 zoom, I can now set the shutter in the Camera pro mode for 1/750, AF=on, iso=auto and as I pan around for the shot the iso makes an attempt to keep up with the varying lighting conditions. It works pretty good though not as well as my Nikon and on an overcast day I thought the shots were consistently underexposed, so I bumped the exposure up to +1EV.\nNow this was only my first few minutes playing with this and I know the below photo's are not good quality but they do show you that with Pro mode with auto iso and a high shutter speed, you can freeze a moving subject.\nHere are two pics of cars traveling at about 55mph while I stand still and snap the shot as they pass through the frame.  The blue car exhibits motion blue and it was taken with the camera in Photo Mode....something we've all experienced with Photo Mode but I do feel that this is better than before.  The white car was taken in Pro mode and while both suffer with focus as I didn't tap the auto focus on, the white car does not exhibit motion blur.\nAgain, please excuse the poor quality but I hope to actually spend more than a minute or two playing with this over the next few days and hopefully I'll have something better to post.\n  ** If my response helps, please click on Like (Heart). If I resolved your issue also please click on Accept as a Solution so that others can benefit.\n\nBill\n---\nGalaxy S21 Ultra 512g(VZW), Galaxy Book (original, VZW), Tab S4, Galaxy Watch3 (VZW)",

These settings include:\n\n\nUsing Force 4x MSAA\n\n\nChanging the transition animations to 0\n\n\nUsing the 120 hz adaptive smoothness\n\n\nPutting the processing speed to high or max\n\n\nIncreasing the Guardian Temperature threshold\n\n\nClosing every single app except the game and YouTube (the main app I use to multi task with)\n\n\nAnd Using Game Boosters as well as Samsung's Game Plug-Ins on max settings.\ne Boosters as well as Samsung's Game Plug-Ins on max settings.\n\n\nIf this is the norm for every Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultras and cannot be fixed then I guess I would just shrug and believe I couldn't do anything about it.\n\nI.e.

If Samsung Music is the native app and your brand app is supposed to work flawlessly. Would also love the \"Play next\" option for songs, to play one next.\n\n6- Compass apparently is **bleep**ed up, everytime I'm on Google maps I have to or show the street (Live View option) or do the 8 figure for it to \"calibrate\" and get its **bleep** together, but even if I do it right now and calibrate it, if I close the app and open it again right there, guess what? Exactly, I'll have to do it again.

I've heard good things about Otterbox, but I do not think they make a GLASS screen/ camera protector.

Unfortunately, after the restart, the device still gave me that prompt, and wouldn't let me use the device unless I backed out of it (it would then pop up again after a couple of seconds). At first, I thought it was an issue with Xfinity, but I went over to my local store, and call technical support and it wasn't anything on there and. The phone was already unlocked. I then went to my carrier to try and see if it was something with my SIM. Couldn't find anything either, other customers have used my type of SIM into newer phones and it would work just fine. Even after resetting the network settings, changing my access point name, and inputting my S21's IMEI into my Cricket plan nothing changed. It is very odd, the S21 still acknowledges that there is a SIM inside the phone, and it can receive calls- I just can't use the phone without dismissing that prompt. I was told by a Samsung technical support technician to visit my local authorized repair center, and if they couldn't fix it, I would have to factory reset the phone with the old SIM inside. However I don't think it's something wrong with the phone. \nHas anyone had this issue before?",

The items below to me would make the perfect phone that everyone would buy I believe.\nMake everything just like the S21 Ultra with the below suggestions.\n1. Keep S21 ultra brightness. This is great.\n2. S21 cameras are great, but better camera system like pixel 6 pro.\n3. Bring back the IR blaster infrared remote control system like in S6 model.\n4. Bring back the Earphone jack.\n5. FM radio - turn on the FM radio chip, not tied to a carrier turning on the chip. This is very useful in emergency situations when power and cell towers are out. Phone becomes worthless without it.\n6. Better speakers and sound system. Make a top firing speaker in the top of the phone just like the bottom firing speaker, instead of using the ear piece. Add a sub-woofer. More bass and umpff at low and loud volumes. This suggestion (#6) alone would make me very happy.\n7. Wider phone like the note series.\n8. Finger print reader on back of phone like S9 model. Currently need 2 hands to use finger print reader.\n9. Make phone rugged - don't need to get a case.\n10. Bring back the notification light.\n11. Flat screen - no curve on edge.\n12. All phones unlocked. Should be up to user who they  connect to.\n13. Solar charging. Phone charges in any light when not plugged into regular charger. This would be great in a survival situation.\n14. Bring back expanded storage.\n15. Quit the smaller bezel stuff. Do a smaller screen with bigger bezels to fit in above stuff. A thicker phone would not be bad either. They are too thin and slippery now.\nJust think, if Samsung came out with a phone with all the above, wouldn't you be extremely interested in this. I think it would beat out all the competition.\nThanks much.",

Where is the option to ALWAYS remove location from shared images? I recall this being an option before. I see there's an annoying/obscure way to do it per image (see screenshots), but I can't find an overall option to always remove location tags when sharing.\n3. Where's the option to convert shared images from HEIF to jpg? Wasn't this an option before? Is this being done automatically now? What if someone wants to share HEIF images? \n4. What about the options for HDR/HEVC videos? Seems there was previously an option for converting these, as well. There's an option in Quick Share for videos, but...wouldn't that only apply to items shared through Quick Share?\n5. Videos used to loop play. This was removed (before android 12). Why not give users an option for this? Many people would like to have this for an option, myself included.\n5. The new share panel has positives and negatives. Quick share being permanently stuck in the first spot is stupid. Stop trying to make us use things that you (Samsung) think are cool. I will be seeing if disabling the Quick share package gets rid of this. When there are only 5 spots, each one is important\n6. Why is it not possible to swipe up on this to see all of your apps? This sideways scroll and then the button to see more is just...bad. It was much simpler and intuitive before, with the swiping up. It's even more confusing as this current share panel looks like you can swipe it up, just like before. \n To remove location you must click the little More> after which this pops up:\n If anyone sees options that I'm missing somewhere, please let me know.",

After the reset it would still restart at random times about twice a day.  I took it to Best Buy Geek Squad and they reinstalled the software, but then it continued to restart as I am scrolling through apps, using the camera, making a phone call.

They ended up sending it back to me, I received it today and as I was setting up the phone it randomly restarted as I was setting up facial recognition.  I talked to Samsung customer service and sent it back for repair again, but I am started to feel defeated.  Has anyone been able to resolve this issue?

    "Anyone else just love their s21? Lol. I always had budget devices in the past except I did have the Samsung epic 4g back in the day. Lol people hate on this phone all the time and I don't get it. Sure an SD card would be nice but I pay 30 dollars a year for 200gb of cloud storage and in reality I prefer cloud because I don't have to worry about an SD card becoming corrupt. People complain about not getting a charging brick. Let's be real they are selling this phone for 200 cheaper than the s20 so paying 15 dollars for a new charging brick isn't a biggie..and the plastic back gets hate and I LOVE it. I have a 3 year old and I much prefer not worrying about both sides of my phone breaking. It makes the phone physically lighter and still looks premium. People think a glass back is premium BECAUSE that's what phone manufacturers tell US is premium because they make bank off of back glass replacements. I hear all the time people saying the s21 has bad battery life but mine doesn't. If I am using my phone without power saving mode on I get 6-7 hours of screen on time and with power savings turned on I get 8-10 hours of screen on time.  I did come from the moto g power that got 16 hours of screen on time but the phone was uncomfortably heavy in the hand. I ALMOST traded in my s21 for the zflip 3 but 3 hours of screen on time is unacceptable especially if you plan to keep it for a few years with battery degradation. Samsung if your listening make a flip next year with solid battery life and I'll switch!! They could make a cheap model with less battery and a more expensive model with a bigger battery.

    "I tried to find a place to give feedback, but it doesn't look like Samsung has any, I guess I will just post it here. Maybe it will be heard?\nSamsung was always the phone that offered freedom to its users in terms of what they could do with their phone. They had expandable storage, changeable, batteries, more flexible software with unlockable bootloaders, cool features like Gear VR and DEX.\nOver the years I have been a Galaxy fan boy, and have converted many lifelong apple users because it was a no brainer for some because of the freedom Samsung gave its users; even though Apple had better apps, better graphics, better cameras, better operating experience because of their inhouse software and hardware.\nBut over time, Samsung has slowly cut out all of the things that made them different from apple; otherwise known as UPS's (unique selling propositions) in marketing terms. And I understand why many of them needed to happen, such as the removable battery and headphone jack.\nHowever the recent removal of the SD card slot may mark the final straw. Without it there just isn't enough to keep Samsung users from the better app support, performance, and 3rd party support of Apple. It seems the Samsung is trying to be like Apple, but when they do that, they will lose, because Apple has been doing it longer and better. \nWith advanced high resolution camera's, it simply doesn't make since to have limited, non-expandable memory. A lot of people like me aren't in the city and cell reception isn't reliable, so cloud storage is not an option. But beyond storage space, removable storage is also very important if the phone becomes damaged or corrupted, because files can be saved by simply removing the card.\nI get many don't use SD card slots, but including a SD slot doesn't hurt or turn anyone away. But removing it slaps many of Samsung loyal users in the face. The SD card slot is the reason my last 3 phones have been Samsung. I am not saying it needs to be on every device Samsung makes, but at least include it on the Ultra line, I don't mind paying a premium for the features that are important to me.\nIf the S22 Ultra doesn't have a SD slot, I will try to hold out one more year with my S8+ to see if the the S23 has it. But if the S23 doesn't have it, then users should decide between the Iphone or the Pixel for more pure operation experiences since Samsung has give up everything that made it unique. At that point there really isn't a reason for the Galaxy to exist.\nI know there will be some that disagree, but this is my 2 cents. I don't think I am the only one.",
    "I always use a theme on my phone and have never had issues with is. Since the update my keyboard will randomly switch back to the original. The first time it happened I switched to a different theme and it's still happening. I've restarted the phone, cleared catched and everything I've read on Google to fix it and it doesn't. It will just randomly switch back to the theme keyboard. I've had issues with my galaxy s21 since I got it in February but for some reason now there isn't a store I can take it to too have it looked at when a couple years ago there was multiple stores I could take it to around me. I don't like that you have to mail the phone in and have to pay if samsung says there isn't a software issue or anything wrong with it. If i have to mail it in, wait, and possibly have to pay for something than it makes more sense for me to make an insurance claim with my phone provider but i shouldnt have to do that if theres been an issue with the phone since a got it.

I'm having loads of issues with Bluetooth with my watch (Huawei GT2 Pro) and my headphones (Soundcore P3).\nWhen both are connected, if I try and make/recieve a call it defaults to my headphones and then drops it so I have to click Bluetooth and select device, my last phone always defaulted calls to the headphones. It does similar when I'm in the car. I've tried changing it so my watch is a input device only and it still happens. If my watch is a input devt only then it shouldn't even display for calls.\nThe other issue is that my watch can no longer find GPS from the phone when walking or going for a run.\nIm hoping I'm being stupid and there are some settings I can change to get this working correctly.\nThanks\n        ",

Pushing out new versions without adequate documentation forces us to spend hours \"playing with\" our phones. I use mine for business and productivity (not for playing) - but over the years I have spent hundreds, probably thousands of hours learning new tech that eventually becomes obsolete (I'm including PC software). Some of this goes with the territory, but MOST of it is because the companies behind the software are saving THEIR time, at the cost of MINE. For this reason, we should ALL have a choice in accepting a new update OR NOT.\nBTW: The URL link provided at the bottom of the What's New screen (as seen on the Software Update page on the phone) goes to the right place - a page full of past updates with explanations, but THIS UPDATE is not yet listed!

    "In August I purchased a Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra to replace my old iPhone SE which had finally given up the ghost, and was very pleased with the product, but 3 months later it already has developed problems.\nOne is a noticeable clicking sound from inside every time the phone is rotated from on its back to on its side and vice versa, and the other is hard to describe a faint scale-like pattern on the left side of the screen which is slightly rough, unlike the rest of the screen and catches the light and can make viewing that part of the screen difficult in certain light conditions or at certain angles.\nThe most annoying problem though, as I use the phone to consume a lot of media: videos, films, audiobooks, is an issue where every two minutes or so the phone will freeze up for a second. The screen flickers black, the orientation is forced from horizontal to vertical, and any media (video or audio) either stops entirely or is minimised and paused. This also causes messages being typed out in some applications like Messenger to be erased if it freezes before I have finished writing them. This is especially frustrating in a product I wanted particularly for the high quality of its display, and which cost as much as my laptop. (EDIT: it doesn't seem to happen in Safe Mode).\nI imagine the clicking sound is from some loose component inside the phone but I have no idea what has caused the other two issues.

    "Samsung is getting greedy, and turning into Apple. No SD slot. No chargers. And the bloatware is obscene. If you're going to charge a thousand dollars+ for a phone - we should be able to control which apps we keep, and which ones we don't. We shouldn't have to risk bricking our phone by rooting it - in order to delete apps off our phones. Samsung must be getting paid bank by the developers of those apps, to FORCE us to have them on our phones.\n The ONLY good thing about these phones is the cameras.\n There's no more SD card. Probably because Samsung is getting kickbacks from the cloud services to force us into using cloud storage - instead of being able to store our photos/videos on the actual phone itself. I don't want my pics/vids vulnerable to hackers and the potential to be lost forever if there's a tech issue with the cloud server.\nThe stupid phones also need to stop trying to do stuff for me that I don't want them to do. For example bringing up the samsung screen asking me if I want to store my PW with samsung EVERY time I try to enter a password somewhere -- or now allowing me to crop my photos without jumping to preset dimensions because it THINKS it knows where the edges are, but does not. You have to accept the preset dimensions, or take a screen shot, and edit it in the actual photo editor in order to get it the way you want.\nOh, and no way to set your phone to automatically open in the video player. Clicking the video brings up a preview of the video, then you have to go to a menu to open it in video player.\nMy S21 Ultra 5G will be the last samsung phone I ever buy (I have been a loyal samsung user for over a decade). The phones suck, and their customer service blows. And every release it gets worse.\nScrew samsung. My next phone will be a pixel. And from the looks of it - I'm not the only one who feels this way.\nIf samsung doesn't get their acts together, they're going to lose a lot of customers.\nStop trying to be like apple. Your customers buy your phones because they're not like iphones. Well they weren't. Now it's pretty much impossible to tell them apart.",

The font is entirely too small, some of my apps will not open, including my outlook email and banking apps. I've updated all my apps, cleared cache, etc but I should not have to do all that to get my phone to work correctly. Someone clearly missed the mark on this update! Keep it simple!! Too many changes at once disappoints the consumer. What's more frustrating is we are all saying the same thing on this forum and Samsung wants us to become the tech and fix it ourselves. Over it!!",

    "Hello,\n I recently updated the phone system to the official release of One UI 4 (Android 12) on my Galaxy S21 Ultra (SM-G998U, Verizon variant). And I found a scrolling issue with many apps. When I have my finger on the screen, the screen refresh rate is at 120Hz. But immediately when I lift my finger, the refresh rate drops to 60Hz. It didn't exist with the previous system (One UI 3.1, Android 11), and it is extremely annoying as it makes the scrolling feel really stuttering.\n The list of the problematic apps that I have tried so far is, Play Store, Gmail, Chrome, Google Drive, Google Podcasts, Twitter, Amazon, Reddit, Weibo and WeChat. Even some of the Samsung's own app have this issue, like Galaxy Store, Gallery, Internet browser. Some other apps like YouTube do not have this issue. Moreover, the overall smoothness of the system is not as good as One UI 3.1.\n I talked to the famous Ice universe on Weibo about it, and it appears this issue is very similar to the One UI 4 beta 2 version released in China and it had been solved in the beta 3 of the Chinese version. I think a fix is definitely needed for the US version of One UI 4!\n Thanks!",

    "A few weeks ago, I got the moisture detected in charging port alarm/error message on my Galaxy S21+. The phone hasn't been in contact with any water at all.\nAfter browsing forums, I worked out that the issue is with Android Auto. When I plug the phone into my 2021 Toyota Rav4 before turning on the ignition, the alarm sounds. This then persists and will sound if I try and use a regular phone charger.\nOnce it's cleared (I can force stop the Android System app to do this), it'll work fine with a regular charger up until it's triggered by plugging it into the car again. \nThe weird thing is that if I start the car before I plug in the phone, then plug it in, the alarm does not sound and Android Auto works fine. I also have to remove the phone before turning the engine off, or the alarm/error returns again. \nThe phone otherwise works perfectly, so this has to be some sort of software issue with either Samsung or Android Auto. Both are on the most current version here in the UK. Has anyone else experienced this? Any solutions? ",

I recently updated to Android 12 on my Galaxy S21 Ultra.\nWhile I love the update and how colorful the deisgn is as well as some simple new features, I feel that it's made my phone slower and not as fluid or smooth than previous updates. I also can sense my refresh rate continues to drop when no touch inputs are detected. I know it has an adaptive refresh rate, but it makes me feel like I'm using a 3 year old phone due to this. It is not as fluid anymore. What are your thought?",
    "As much as I love the new changes of One Ui 4, which is very good in my opinion. Hoping samsung would also focus on app fluency and opening speed of stock apps most especially the camera, basing off from the reviews, there is still a very noticeable delay in opening and closing the app, and you almost always have to wait a second or two for it to completely load, like its not instantaneous like on other os where you can literally flick your finger  back and forth in opening and closing an app and it wont stutter. Also please fix the shutter lag on S21 and very soft low bitrate of videos in any resolution. Lastly to add more sense of fluency and continuity, in app switcher please make it so that the preview of the actual app is shown in the app switcher instead of just a black or blank screen especially in the camera where it turns black when you go to switch apps. And please remove the automatic brightness of the screen when the camera is open, maybe that’s what causing the lags and scene optimizer and the disconnected vibration settings, qr code and document scanner turned making it slow down.

I want an option to make it so that the refresh rate isn't affected when my power saving turns on because I want to use power saving mode and have it do the other things it does, but I hate how choppy my phone feels at 60 Hertz now that I'm using 120 so please make that an option.

    "I am writing as a fan and active user of Galaxy smartphones. I, like all users, want to get the most out of my device, which is why I chose a Samsung smartphone. One of the most important aspects of a smartphone is its camera. And in this regard, I have suggestions for improving my device's camera software. I would like the following features to be added in future updates (for example, One UI 4):\nI would like the following features to be added to the system Camera app:\n 1) keep the selected lens (zoom level) when switching camera modes;\n2) the ability to zoom in all camera modes (selfie, portrait, slow motion, etc.);\n3) Night mode in Portrait mode (like on the Galaxy S21 Ultra, because this is a software feature, not a hardware one);\n4) the ability to use all lenses (ultra wide, telephoto) in some shooting modes – Slow motion (for example, you can shoot 120 FPS video on an ultra wide lens, therefore you can add slow motion), Pro, Hyperlapse;\n5) the ability to use the flash when shooting with an ultra wide lens (possible in third-party apps), as well as in super stabilization mode;\n6) the ability to adjust the exposure time in the night mode (not just choosing \"Max.\", but choose seconds);\n7) flash (screen backlight) when recording video on the front camera (implemented in Google Camera);\n😎 the ability to switch between lenses while recording video in the UHD 60 FPS format (currently I can switch to the front camera, but in my opinion, switching to an ultra-wide-angle lens is much more useful);\n9) the ability to forcibly select a telephoto lens in night mode;\n10) video stabilization in the Portrait video mode;\n11) auto frame rate mode when recording video in UHD format (at least 24/30 FPS);\n12) higher HDR when recording video (it's so good in photo, but not enough in video).\n Allow third party camera apps to:\n 1) use all lenses (ultra wide angle, telephoto), in particular, provide access to the front camera on Snapdragon models (RAW support);\n2) use a larger exposure range when taking a photo (from 1/12000 sec. to 30 sec.);\n3) shoot video with different frame rates (60, 120, 240 FPS).\n ",

    "Roughly 30-40 days ago, I bought a Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra from a T-Mobile store in Washington. Along with the phone I bought a fast wireless charger. I bought the expensive, recommended brand (ubiolabs 15W) for fast wirelesss charging capabilities. I paid $50. Compare that to the $30 lower end wireless chargers if someone doesn't care about the faster charging. \n\nThe first charge I was happy to see that fast wireless charging was working as expected. I looked for the first few days, but eventually I had no real reason to check the screen nightly when setting the phone on the pad to ensure it was in the \"fast\". The rumble and light signals that I have my phone properly charging. \n\nI accepted updates that came within the first few days of having the phone. One of the updates disabled fast wireless charging on chargers not on some list. I didn't notice for quite some time that it downgraded because it currently stays on the charger long enough to be fully charged and not raise red flags. \n\nIs this something that I can expect to get fixed? I'd be happy with the charger I bought being added to the approved chargers? I don't see why I should foot the bill and buy a new charger when I bought the \"top of the line\" model phone and charger. Obviously it isn't the best charger out there, but I know it isn't dangerous, and there is no reason why Samsung should be restricting my charger's output capabilities. \n\nIt worked. Now it doesn't.

Now that the sale has ended and the offer has passed with a wasted two weeks, Samsung is only offering to refund my original amount without any further compensation or at least a price match of the supposed proper price that should have been offered during the sale. Samsung offers great technology but honestly their customer service is shocking to say the least.",

For whatever reason, that doesn't seem to do the trick for me. \nTonight, I finally took the plunge and tried a factory reset. I was temporarily elated because everything worked great, no drops. Then, I installed my work profile and almost immediately started getting the issue again. I found some forums that suggest this issue also arises from an isssue switching between profiles.\nFor what it's worth, I have a router with a single SSID for both 2.4 and 5ghz bands.

Does this much Knox Enterprise come on every S21 Ultra? My phone is for personal-use only and there seems to be quite a lot of business-related logging and monitoring of my daily use? And.KLMS Security agents constantly running in the background? I can see log files saved to the internal storage but I dont have permission to view them. They're hidden. Basically there's a **bleep**-ton of business ware that came pre-loaded on this device, and it runs all the time. I'm beginning to resent being (blatantly) spied on.\n\nI have learned my lesson about carrier-branded phones. I should not have bought this AT&T Galaxy S21 Ultra. I should have opted for the unlocked version directly from Samsung. The best way to put it is, this phone just doesn't run right. The enterprise mobile security on here is ridiculous. Instead of the owner of my phone who's able to use it freely, I feel more like a managed user with zero permissions. I'm starting to wonder if I've received an AT&T Business phone intended for corporate use? Anything to help me understand the main differences between business and regular S21 Ultra from AT&T would be much appreciated. What would you do about it if you received a phone with software like this one has.....Any suggestions?\n\nThanks in advance for your perspective!\nBeth",

    "I've had four Samsung phones in the past,, and liked them. All were purchased via carrier though. I ordered an unlocked S21 Ultra 256GB on September 6th from Samsung. Original estimated delivery was October 4th. Then, October 6th, then, October 19th. \nI canceled on October 12th. The delays were annoying, but every time I contacted support, I was told something different. The final insult: I went to the purchase page, and they said a new oder would ship \"today.\" Yet mine, ordered weeks earlier, still wasn't shipping. \nIf Samsung is encouraging customers to try different brands, they're succeeding.

    "Dear Samsung,\nCouple of things I want to suggest on future software updates, hoping these features would make it.\n*More fluid animations at 60 fps .\n*Zoom In/Out of wallpaper animation when opening/closing an app . gives much more fluid feel. and animated icons\n*Fully transparent gesture navigation bar without overlapping on apps and without using good lock.\n*Prettier material design lock screen widgets for spotify,music player, youtube, notifications etc.\n*Fix-Face unlock camera not focused upon set up. (thats why it's slow sometimes).\n*Fix sensitivity of Lift to wake feature like on ios.\n*Bigger icons on Quick panel like on ios and other devices. for easier reach like for wifi button bluetooth button, volume button, and brightness slider and music player.\n* Tap to wake instead of douple tap to wake. (if aod is not on) much easier.\n*Fix-Gesture navigation haptic feedback only when opening app switcher not on exiting an app. its too redundant\n*Fix- Bigger icons on homescreen with 5×6 layout, without having to use screen zoom.\n* AOD turns off when in pocket to save battery.\n*Camera flash assist when focusing in pro mode\n*Cuter/Better looking emojis \n*Just a couple of suggestions. This is just a short list, Hoping that Samsung Software Developer Team would be able to look into this. Pls like and share so it will be viewed by more people. You can refer to this google docs for other feature suggestions worldwide as well.

First I got an email stating the Fold 3 was not returned, I had confirmation of receipt and the tracking number and name who accepted.

However, leaving location on all the time is very costly to battery life, and I don't need every single photo to be geotagged anyway, only certain ones. Also, it's much easier to enable/disable location from the quick settings menu when I want certain photos geotagged than to go to Camera > Settings > Location Tags.

    "Help!!! My S21 Ultra keeps blocking a call from a contact in my phone. This person has only successfully called me twice at random times without being sent straight to voicemail but every other time she calls it sends her straight to voicemail. She is able to text me and Duo me but she isn't able to make calls to me. The call long indicates \"Blocked Spam Call, Declined by Phone\". I am able to call her but she isn't able to call me unless for some odd reason my phone allows the call to go through. I've looked in the contacts setting and I don't have anything blocking her. She too is a Samnsung user, she has a SNOW 20 Ultra.  I have this contact marked on my favorites and have had them in my contacts forever. I never experienced this problem before and can't figure out how to allow her to be able to call me without having to text me and ask me to call her. Any suggestions would be helpful! Thanks in advance!! ",
    "I bought the s21 Ultra through tmobile and used a new sim card they gave me but the phone came with a sim card. The issue that I'm having is my phone is on 5G all the time it literally never drops 5G until I make a phone call. Soon as I make a phone call it drops down to 4GLTE and my mobile voice network type drops from NR SA which I believe is (New Radio Stand Alone 5G if I'm not mistaken. My phone is always on 5G, 100% of the time until I make any call and my mobile voice network type is always on NR SA as well right up until I make any phone call. Could this be SIM card related perhaps? I still have the SIM that came new in the box with the s21 Ultra. Only reason they put a different SIM in my phone is because I had just gotten a new tmobile SIM card a week prior. They both say R15 on them, but the design on them are slightly different. How can I tell if this is affecting my VOLTE? I'm considering going back up to a tmobile store to register the SIM that came with the phone but I don't wanna waste my time if it's not the issue. They take hours in these stores to do anything and they try to charge me for every little thing.",
    "I have a brand new Verizon S21 Ultra 256gb, ordered from Verizon, and it came with a free EB-U1200 wireless charger.  I used it for the first time last night, placing the phone on the charger on my nightstand, keeping the phone on for emergencies.\nIn the morning, it was at 100% as expected, but both the Phone and Charger were fairly warm to hot, which I didn't expect.  I assumed that once the phone reached 100%, it would switch to a trickle charge state, which wouldn't generate much heat.\nI have another older Samsung charger (EP-PG950), used with my prior Note 8, and neither the Note 8 nor the charger ever got noticeably warm.  I haven't tried this charger overnight with the S21 Ultra yet.\nSo this raises several questions:\nShould the phone and charger be that warm when left overnight?\nIs it detrimental to battery life and quality to routinely leave it on a charger (wireless or wired) overnight?\nCurrently, I have \"Fast Charging,\" \"Super fast charging\" and \"Fast wireless charging\" all enabled - would disabling some or all of these be best for overnight charging, and would this eliminate the heat problem?\nI've researched this, and inevitably find conflicting information on \"best practice\" in this regard, but am curious to see what knowledgeable members here think, perhaps specifically with regard to the S21 Ultra.\nThanks.",

    "Anyone else experiencing this issue, and anyone come across any solutions?\n Since the May release I’ve found that my unlocked snapdragon S21 Ultra 512GB has been experiencing significant focus issues on the main camera. It almost behaves like it already has a focus lock on something, and no attempts to focus on alternate subjects has any effect.\n If I switch to the Ultra-wide, the 3x tele, or the 10x tele, they all work exactly as expected and are in focus/can focus on other subjects with a tap. If I bring my hand up close to the lens and Focus Enhancer turns on (which I understand is just the phone switching to the ultra-wide), everything comes into focus, but then when I remove my hand it returns to the main camera and is out of focus.\nExample of what I’m describing can be seen here\nThis has been happening on my phone since the May release, and so far I’ve had three releases since, none of which has seemed to improve this behavior. Currently running G998U1UEU4AUF5\n Troubleshooting steps attempted thus far:\n Usually when this happens, I’ve tried a handful of steps which inconsistently seem to help. The aforementioned step of holding my hand close to the lens so focus enhancer turns on and then pulling it away (so it switches back to the main camera) will often be enough for it to seemingly correct it’s focus lock and then the main camera will begin focusing properly again. This is what I attempt most of the time – and sometimes it works but not consistently.\nI also force quit the camera app and clear the camera app’s cache. This has had inconsistent results as well. I’ve also tried wiping all data associated with the camera app – again with varied results in correcting the main camera focus issues. Most of the time I tend to just ‘miss the moment’ I was trying to capture, or if I’m really in a time crunch, find a way to make it work with either the ultra-wide or 3x lens.\n Anyone else experiencing this issue with the main camera? Anyone have any more reliable steps for correcting the issue when it occurs?",

My phone connects to the headunit via USB but the phone calls and some other features all go via Bluetooth - including phone calls.\nThe issue is that every time I am on a call it will randomly drop the Bluetooth repeatedly at various intervals.

Then set up AA again.\nCleared Bluetooth System Protocol Data and Cache.\nReset Network Settings.\nTurned off Bluetooth scanning in location settings.\nChecked in developer settings to see if any settings might help - couldn't see anything relevant.\nWhat I have not done, and would like to avoid if possible, is a factory reset of the handset.

    "So I've had MANY Samsung devices in my day. It's a bit of a love/hate relationship with the brand. Sometimes there are hits and other times there are straight up misses.\nI bought a S20 Ultra in 2020 and the camera glass cracked, developed a hole, and condensation eventually killed the device. Instead of paying the insane price of repair, I was so dissatisfied with performance of the camera in that $1400 device, I chalked it up to a paperweight and got a Pixel 3a XL. When I tell you that the $350 Pixel produce more consistent and better quality photos than my Galaxy S20 Ultra, I mean it. So I rocked the 3a XL for about a year until the S21 was announced. While the camera performance was spectacular, the device was slow and annoying. So, instead of going all in like I did the Ultra, I decided to get a S21 5G instead. \n\nWhile the 120Hz OLED is beautiful, performance is mega, and the hardware is gorgeous, the camera generally disappoints. The images are inexplicably blurry, the shutter speed snaps photos much later after you press the shutter button, and zooming in on photos only shows graininess and lack of sharpness. And don't get me started on the selfie camera. It still tries to \"beautify\" my face, even with the effects and filters turned off.\n\nI thought I was misremembering my experience on my Pixel, so I pulled it out for some comparison shots and turns out, I wasn't. The photos from the Pixel 3a XL were much more pleasing out of auto-mode than on my S21 5G. Not just sorta better, but NOTICIBLY better. I was also more easily able to whip my phone out of my pocket, take a shot, and assume it was fine, than immediate reviewing it on my Galaxy to see if I needed to take it again, and maybe again, to finally get a usable shot.\n\nIt is frustrating listening to the marketing hype and show that Samsung puts on every year only to be outperformed by a $350 device in this area ESPECIALLY since Samsung likes to use marketing photos that are seemingly DSLR-like quality.\n\nThat's all to say, what am I doing wrong with my S21 in auto-mode to make the photos experience so challenged?",

Some call where so faint I couldn't hear the caller on voice or video calls. I had to hold phone at awkward angles not optimal for the connection type. The lower speaker had it own issues with volume.\n\nI never did fid why the volume fluctuate from call to call. It still has issues intermittently.\n\nThe reason i titled this post \"A right handed phone\" is because I wanted to get community feedback on this issue..\n\nWhen I hold the S21 to my right ear the sound level is at a normal level. When I switch to the other ear the volume drops drastically. Has anyone else noticed this?\n\nComparing how the S21 is built vs S9 , the speaker on the S21 is on top right edge of phone vs the top mid front facing for the S9. When I hold to my left ear the speaker lay in scapha or above the helix of the ear.\n\nAnytime I want to multi-task on a phone call and use my dominant hand for something else I have adjust the phone to an uncomfortable position. \n\nYou can't fix my phone but Samsung please reevaluate the speaker position for your next generation.

    "It is not a complaint against Samsung product itself, but against their official repairing stores. I have been a long-time customer of Samsung Galaxy for the past 10 years. As a matter of fact, all my friends are using iPhones, and I am the only one still using a Galaxy phone.\nAbout two weeks ago, I replaced phone screen of my S21 under factory warranty at UBREAKIFIX #688 - Carmel Mountain Ranch. Later I found out that the technician left some fingerprints inside the camera sensor, and I was not able to clean it from outside.\nSince I do not have tools to open the cellphone back cover, I went to their store again and ask them to clean the fingerprints for me. The store staff refused to admit the fingerprints were left by their technician, and instead would charge me for the cleaning labor. When I refused to pay the amount she demanded, she asked me to leave the store.\nThe cost of cleaning was not the issue. If the staff at least admits their mistake and gives an apology, I actually don't mind paying the labor since I understand it will not be covered by warranty. However the store staff was rude and keeps implying I opened the cellphone up myself and left fingerprints on camera sensor. When I showed her how photos are cloudy and blurry from the camera now, she acted like it was no big deal, even it was their technitian who left the fingerprints there.\nWorst repairing experience ever had.

    "Edit: I accidentally marked this as solved when another member offered a possible solution but unfortunately I still can’t get it working.\nOriginal Post:\nI would love to see a built in option to have my screen wake for notifications. I see that for some reason, a good amount of people seem to be requesting the opposite of what I want to be a feature on One UI for the S21 series. Coming from iOS, I am used to my phone screen waking briefly when I receive a notification, as this is a default setting. \nTo me, this is an awesome feature because it allows me to quickly look at my screen, without having to interact with it, and see what notification I just received. Because of my job, I always keep my phone on vibrate only and it doesn't make sense to switch back and forth so it can ring after work hours, since I may forget to switch back to vibrate and my phone might start going off while I'm in an important call or meeting. \nI also have a Galaxy Watch 3, and I was surprised to see that in the settings, there is an included option to \"turn on the watch screen when  Notifications are received.\" This only helps me when I am wearing the watch so when I don't have it on, I have to constantly check to see if I missed any notifications. If the phone is near me, I sometimes don't hear/feel it vibrate, but I'd the screen turns on, it immediately gets my attention. \nTo note, I mostly use Whatsapp for messaging and to my knowledge, the Messages app is the only one that wakes the screen when messages come in. \nIf this setting can be enabled for the watch and for messages, why not have it as an option for the phone itself? \nIt is clear that Samsung is trying to capture a portion of the iOS market and it will only help them more to have some features that people coming from iOS are accustomed to. Even if it is only enabled in vibrate mode, that would already be huge for people that are used to having this feature on their iOS devices.",

    "I've been a Samsung Brand Loyalist since way back when Samsung TVs overtook the Sony Trinitron line of TVs as best in class and consumer purchase numbers. I'm not completely certain what the original appeal was beyond that or why the likes of LG or other equivalent brands of the day got no love from me back then. Fast forward to today, and I know exactly why. The second Samsung Galaxy smart phone I owned was the Galaxy S5, and that phone was a large part of why Samsung earned my loyalty. But the relationship would not be completely solidified until the company severely <edit> in the design of that iterations replacement. \n  When the Galaxy S6 line was released, I was beside myself with frustration, confusion, and basically severe disappointment. While the new S6 designs were the impitus of those negative reactions, the focus of my ire was squarely on the company itself for basically designing out the very features that compelled me to purchase the S5 in the first place. They decided to eliminate the removable/ replaceable battery back when carrying around an extra fully charged battery for your phone was commonplace. They decided to eliminate the ¼\" headset jack, doing so before quality Bluetooth headsets were hardly affordable and Bluetooth LE wasn't even a thing. And then they decided to eliminate the MicroSD card dock way before the concept of reliable cloud storage was anywhere near as widespread as it needed to be. \n  There were more features that were curtailed and/ or eliminated in the S6 series, but these were the three that I found to represent the common underlying offense which lead to Samsung choosing to make these changes, an error that is far too commonly committed by manufacturers and service providers across the economy. Samsung simply chose that the S6 series was going to be the pivot point where they would abandon the needs and desires of their core global customer base, and instead of offering hardware that met the needs of this customer base, they would now begin to mimick the designs of their most challenging industry competitor, the iPhone. The Samsung Galaxy mobile hardware division simply lost its way and tried to be something they were not, and which their customers didn't want them to be.\n  Life's most valuable lessons are almost always delivered in the most painful experiences possible. There isn't a company in existence that hasn't dropped the ball in some way or fashion. It's actually a healthy process to go through for most, assuming the after action review of the failure is analyzed and corrective actions are taken. As is the case with individuals and companies alike, there is no greater catalyst for improvement or the gaining of knowledge then that which results from a complete and total failure. It's all about how that failure is handled and leveraged.\n  Once the anemic S6 features, or lack there of, were released and those like me who had been excited to upgrade but quickly became resigned to keeping the older phones we had, it wasn't long before the magnitude of the design failures started to become clear to Samsung leadership. I was only one of probably millions of disappointed people who were ready to buy the new S6, but decided not to. While I'll never know how many were compelled to voice our frustrations directly to the company via a very terse, yet well crafted email, I'm willing to bet it was a whole lotta people. \n  We were Samsung customers for many reasons, one of the most significant being that Samsung was NOT iPhone. We chose Samsung because they didn't try to push it's customers into recent innovations in technology which were both excessivly priced and still unproven, something iPhone is always doing. We chose Samsung because they offered phones that were designed with utility and user customizable features that empowered us to make the phone work best for our specific needs, not a one size fits all mantra like iPhone. So what on Earth compelled Samsung to try and be the very company they were valued as not being? \n  My loyalty was cemented a year later when Samsung released the next iteration of the Galaxy line, the S7 series. It was one of the first times I had been watching closely enough to see what it looked like when a multinational corporation chooses to listen to it's customers' collective needs, and I was beyond impressed. They didn't bring back everything, removable batteries were never going to remain mainstream, especially as the technology becomes more and more capable with each iteration. But sure enough, they heard us, they listened to what we were saying, and they reversed course with the vast majority of features. The fact that I would quickly grow to despise my S7 Edge on account of the Edge feature, Samsung was back on track!\n  After beating <edit> the S7 everyday in my steering wheel everyday when the stupid Edge screen would come into contact with a part of my hand and erroneously do things to enrage me, I knew I would never purchase another phone with that utterly worthless gimmicky feature. The problem was, they decided to make that Edge thing a standard design feature with all of the following year's S8 series phones, much to my dismay. But patience paid dividends for me when I read about the mid-cycle release of the S8 Active model. \n  I had never really looked at the Active versions of the older iterations, and I'm not even sure I was aware of them. But this S8 Active had everything I could want, a bigger battery, no stupid Edge screen, and something I wouldn't realize about the phone until I had it for a few weeks. One of the many reasons I'm never going to own an iPhone as a primary cell phone is an experience I had with an older iPhone 5. I don't remember why I had it, but I do remember accidentally dropping onto a hardwood floor from a height no greater than 2½ feet up. From my perspective watching the phone drop in slow motion, I still am amazed at how the moment the frame came into contact with the floor, the screen didn't just crack. No, the screen seemed to enthusiastically explode out as though it had been waiting to do so it's entire life, and in an instant, the iPhone went from useful to useless. Done. \n  I've dropped plenty of Samsung Galaxy phones throughout my life, all from differing heights, some faring better then others, but none exploding in glee like that iPhone. That said, the durability of that S8 Active was ridiculously high, and trust me when I say this, I tested that thing on more than once occasion. In at least one bout of ginger rage triggered by the phone not functioning how I wanted it to, it survived without a scratch after being overhand day pitched into a wall about 6 feet away, the sheetrock suffering all that damage (I've since repaired it because it wasn't the sheetrock's fault!). \n  I would be compelled to maintain that S8 Active for years beyond it's dated technology because Samsung, for whatever reason, decided to do away with all Active variants in any Galaxy iterations that would come after the S8. Why, why do you do these things Samsung? The S21 Ultra is a beast which almost has the feel of an Active model once tucked into the Spigen case I use for all my phones. But I bet there is plenty of demand for an S21 Active if you made one. No, the corporate rugged XCover model that sorta looks like an Active doesn't rate. My <edit> 3 year old S8 Active had a more powerful processor and better features than that underdeveloped model offered. I want all the Gucci hotness you guys stuffed into this ridiculously capable S21 Ultra offered in a <edit> housing that can easily shrug off an occasional overhand fast pitch into a wall because I know you guys can build it. If you do this and relaunch the Active models, I'll be a Samsung customer for life. If you don't do it, I'll still be a Samsung customer for life, so I'm really not in a position to negotiate. Do it to make the exploding iPhones screens look even more stupid!",

So I get online with Samsung Tech Support, and when I told them about the Verizon comment made against Samsung, she simply said \"well thats good to know\", as if she were going to do something about it! Shortly afterward she sent me some sort of instructions to clear the cache memory on my phone, needless to say it did not work and meantime I still have no voice mail and I'm still being billed for it monthly of course!\nMy phone is a brand new S21 Ultra 5G, and it was not cheap to say the least! There are also multiple other problems with this expensive thing but I'm gonna tackle one at a time I guess so if anyone has any advice other than to burn this phone I'd be very happy to try it out!\nPlease help!!!\nThanks in advance!!!",

    "I have been a Samsung Galaxy user for several years.  I just purchased the S21 Ultra, and was shocked to find out that it does not have the capability to create and add an automatic signature to outgoing text messages!  Whose idea was it to eliminate that function?  Ouch! That is a critical feature in my line of work, and something that I would also consider to be a primary \"common sense feature\" even for more casual users.  How many times have you wondered who sent you a message, because you don't recognize the number?  That happens all the time!  I found out that Verizon has Message+ that would allow me to add a signature.  That isn't an ideal alternative, though, for reasons I won't go into now.  Besides ...  doesn't it seem ridiculous to spend this kind of money on a device and then hope you can find an app somewhere just so you can add a function that should be considered a basic essential of the device?  Sorry to go on so long, but I wanted to be sure there are strong reasons for this request.  Everyone I have mentioned this to is shocked to learn that the device can't do that.  Can you PLEASE get that function added as an update to the S21 Ultra ASAP.  You had it on your previous devices, so the process should be rather quick.  Thank you! \nNOTE: I would like to make some suggestions on a couple of changes to the text message signature function when you add it. \n1) Previously it had about 30 characters available. I would suggest making it at least 60. \n2) Since many people need to use their device for personal use AND for work, I suggest creating a \"toggle\" that gives the user the opportunity to choose between 2 different signatures when they send a message.  That one might be more complicated and take more time to develop.  If so, I would suggest rolling out the first change right away while this one is being developed.",

    "I am very pleased to say that my struggles with the Galaxy S21 fingerprint sensor are OVER  ...  and no visit to UbreakIFixit was needed. That may come as some relief to those who suffered through my anger and frustration in earlier posts. As a token of my appreciation to you all for putting up with me, I am glad to share what I learned.\nIt certainly could be possible that your fingerprint sensor is, in fact, defective. This is, after all, a new phone in its first months of production. But you should try these steps first, before making a visit to Ubreak.\nYou should watch a few videos of people who really know how to work with the fingerprint sensor successfully. Watch how they register their fingers; watch how they use the sensor to actually sign in. That was my big \"Aha\" moment. So that's the way you're supposed to hold your finger! That's the way you're supposed to press on the sensor! Who knew?\nAnd on the subject of your finger: Don't use your finger - use your thumb. You're giving the sensor more skin to read.\nOnce you have successfully registered your thumb(s) or your finger(s) don't stop there. Go ahead and practice unlocking your phone with the fingerprint sensor. Do it several times. The more often you do this (up to a point, probably) the faster the sensor recognizes your thumb/finger.\nNow that you're getting the hang of it, watch a video from a Fingerprint Master, like \"Jimmy is Promo\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9v3H1dOyQc to learn secrets for making the fingerprint sensor work faster. This stuff really works.\nAt last, I have unlocked the secrets of the Galaxy S21 fingerprint sensor! Now, instead of using my middle finger to talk to my phone, I use my thumbs to unlock it.",

    "All,\nI had posted about my WiFi Calling turning itself off. For some reason after a Moderator replied to my post, I can no longer reply. It keeps telling me that either I didn't verify my email address when I signed up (I'm getting email replies when someone posts), or something else I can't remember. So here we go.\nThe Moderator was likely blaming my WiFi router, and telling me I'd probably need to buy an amp ($400 for a good one), or buy a newer router.  I'm not about to do that after spending money on an expensive S21+.  I shouldn't need to. According to US Cellular's maps, I'm in a strong signal area and should even get 5G. Nope. Never seen the 5G icon at my home. And someone I see \"No Cellular Service\". \nMy Asus AC66R is fully updated to the latest firmware and put's out a strong -35dBm signal. And I also have repeaters in the house where I need them. Oh, and I work at a large company that has about 1000 repeaters that are less than a year old, plus a state-of-the-art WiFi system in the building. My WiFI Calling turns itself off there too. There's several repeaters just in the lab I work in. \nFurther, he stated that WiFi Calling is a Carrier specific function and so it has to be a carrier problem, not a phone problem. NOT !  WiFi Calling \"ability\" is carrier specific. The \"function\" of being able to turn it on or off IS WITHIN THE PHONE'S SOFTWARE. The carrier has no ability to turn my WiFi Calling switch on or off. Strike two from Samsung Support.\nLast night while trying to turn it on, it kept asking me for my 911 info which I'd already put in a few days back. Every time I'd press on ACCEPT, it would loop back and ask me to put it in again ... over and over and over. It would never turn on the WiFi Calling then. That smells to me like a software issue.  But I'll admit, it could be a hardware issue too. \nI just got off the phone with US Cellular's technicians, and heard two very interesting things:\n1. The problem with WiFi Calling does not happen with ANY other brand of phone they sell ... only Samsung. He rattled off about 6 other brands they sell ... no WiFi Calling issues with any of them. Only Samsung. It is a known issue that they have talked to Samsung about many times according to this technician. \n2. The weak signal receive that is making me need to use WiFi Calling (never had to before with any other phone I used including a Samsung S8+) is ALSO a known problem with the S21 phones. They've also talked to Samsung about this.\nI wish I'd known all of this prior to buying a Samsung S21+.  And the other mistake I made was buying the phone directly from Samsung,  having to deal with support staff there that don't know what they're talking about, and shipping phones back and forth.\nOh ...

    "So I accidentally spilled my Mountain Dew can and some of the liquid went into the bottom side of my S21. I dried it off immediately with some cloth. I checked my SIM card port and it like no liquid got inside and there was no pink colored strip inside either. It looked dry so I also checked by putting my charger in through the USBC port. My phone got a notification that moisture was detected so I removed the charger immediately. I then blew some air into the USBC port and speaker. Used a q-tip to swab everything inside the USBC port. I put the charger back in and there was no notification of moisture. However, I am worried that because Mountain Dew is very caustic will it cause any future damage if there are still bits of it inside, particularly the SIM port, USBC port, and bottom right speaker? I was checking what to do in the support page and it said to rinse out the USBC port with water. Can I just use my faucet's tap water to rinse it out and let it dry?",
    "I started using the Samsung Music app when I got the S8, and it worked just as well on my S10. I've also been purchasing music through iTunes for years, under the MPEG-4 (.m4a) audio format. These songs played just fine on my S8 and S10.\nI recently upgraded to the S21 and used Smart Switch to transfer all of my music from the S10 to the S21. All of my old music plays normally. However, any music that was purchased (via iTunes) after I started using my S21 has issues with the audio cutting out and sounding very static-y about 30% of the time I select them with my Buds on. If I start playing the song on the speaker and then connect my Buds, audio cutting always follows. After clicking the song a few times, the song plays normally. However, these newly purchased songs are totally unplayable using Android Auto, as the audio cuts out every single time I select them.\nI have re-installed the Samsung Music app and re-downloaded the songs with audio issues from iTunes multiple times, to no avail. How do I fix this? I assume nothing has changed in the way iTunes encodes their audio files since I got the S21, this happens over bluetooth and the speaker (therefore bluetooth isn't the issue), and all my old purchases play without any issues. I can't think of any explanation other than the S21 being the issue here.",
    "So I purchased the s21 5G. The model number to be exact is SM-G991u1. I use it on straight talk using the Verizon sim card. I called straight talk and asked them if I should be getting 5g and they said yes. They checked my service area, I'm in a 5g ready service area. I already knew I was. My cousin has Verizon and gets 5g everywhere in our town. Long story short , I meet all 5g requirements. But I am not getting 5g. There is no 5g settings in network settings. When I had the att sim card in, there still wasn't any 5g settings. Only lte/4g/3g and 3g. \n It's frustrating, I've updated the phone. I've reset it. I've done everything and I can't figure out why. Straight talk has advised that I have 5g access but nobody knows why I don't have 5g. Usually I can figure this stuff out but I'm lost. I downloaded the Samsung band selector. And there is no 5g bands to choose from in that either. It's like this phone doesn't support 5g. I get lte and lte+ just fine. \n Any help would be greatly appreciated. I got this device from rent a center. Don't bash me, it's the only way I could afford to get a new device. I broke my note20. Thank you. ",

    "I think I discovered a software bug with the wireless charging feature on the S21 Ultra. I recently bought a Qi wireless charger for my car that supports wireless fast charging (10W). For some reason, whenever I plug in a USB-C to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter (Samsung EE-UC10JUWEGUS) it changes the charging speed to a slower one. As soon as I unplug the jack adapter it goes back to fast charging. I tested my phone out with other Qi chargers that support 10W fast charging with and without the jack adapter and I get the same results. I then tried plugging in a normal USB-C cable (not connected to any power source) and the wireless fast charging worked fine. Therefore, the problem must be with USB-C to 3.5mm jack adapter. I tried using an older Note 8 with the jack adapter and the wireless fast charging worked fine. This is rather annoying because my car does not have Bluetooth and I need that adapter to listen to my music, get directions from google maps, and make calls.",

    "I ordered my S21 Ultra 128g titanium on Jan. 27. No where on the site or any notice from within the ordering process was I notified of any type of delay. I first started calling about 10 days after my order as it has been shown under the status from day one as \"expedited\". I spoke with a rep and they said because I ordered titanium that it would be longer since it was a special order. I was seriously unhappy with that response since NO WHERE on the site or within ordering process did it say that special color schemes (or the like) would take longer to process being a special order.\n\nThey couldn't give me a timeline, only that it's *expedited* in the shipping process order status. The add-ons were free but they have a ship date of March 31, but it doesn't say that the phone itself will be shipped on that date. Is the wording to upkeep hope that the phone will come sooner and the rest at the later date or that is the overall actual date of the phone shipment but they don't want to ward off buyers for taking so long? Who knows (I'll admit I wouldn't wait because the point of getting the newest release is that one gets it relatively close to that release date).\n\nAnyway, I tried to cancel three times and after the third time when a rep said it could be done, I received an email saying that due to manufacturing process it has to remain in the system, that I can just reject it when it gets shipped to me (this was said by the first two phone reps). Seriously, that is how one cancels an order, like they're making it appear that it's a carved in stone process. This is yet another way to get the customer to just take the phone upon arrival. So, I ask if I order a black phone how long that would take, they said about 2 weeks. But after reading how some here are waiting a month for just that color scheme, I am totally put off .\n Here's the real kicker; just got an email today (February 19) that my order is now delayed (remember what I said about March 31) and that my phone will ship no later than April 7 (or before). So this kind of confirms that my order wasn't going to ship until March 31 along with the add-ons. Just WOW, two and a half months after ordering this device will I get it. Darn, that will be pushing into the next Samsung releases of phones!\n tl;dr\n Ordered S21 Ultra Titanium on Jan 27, got email saying that it won't be shipped until no later than April 7, that's about 2.5 months! :grimacing_face:\n Edit update: having a online chat abt the delay the rep abruptly ended that chat. Now trying to get back has an even longer wait. This is customer service for you. I am just going to reject the phone when it arrives. Not taking a phone that's near halfway though a release cycle to the next release in August.\n ",
    "Since the day after I traded in my Galaxy A50 to upgrade to my brand new out of the box Galaxy S21 Plus, I've been dealing with multiple issues beginning with inability to connect to Wi-Fi public Hotspot which I use for everything in my place for past nine years and no check issues even if I have several devices connected. the s21+ wouldn't even see the xfinitywifi broadcast like my other devices do, then it would see it and attempt connection only to get authentication errors. everyone I've ever talked to about wifi issues are robots that all say reboot your modem. I DON'T HAVE A MODEM because I use public Hotspot. sorry for yelling, my blood pressure rises thinking about this. anyway tech says factory data reset (I knew better), but I did it anyway, then it gets worse, lost contacts, important apps from my employer, important vm's, because my ringer refused to operate even, volume was erratically adjusting itself hi low hi low anytime I attempt blue tooth connection, then my messaging app would race my pandora app upon blue tooth connecting as well I would win that by fighting both apps but still my messaging app would stay on simultaneously with pandora. my s21+ I got brand new unopened $1k on payment plan. Verizon said too late for warranty is only good for 14 days after purchase. keep telling these people my issues began on day one and on day three I finally had time to call support the first time. the store I bought it from (go wireless), tried very hard to help fix it but they only knew what settings to check but they were all correctly set. magically they were able to get my ringer to work and called me a couple times while I was there to test. after I get home, my ringer magically would not work once again. since Verizon was trying to rip me off by telling me they can only replace the s21+ under their 14 day warranty with a certified pre-owned s21+ but at that time, it was beyond the 14 day warranty period. I so I got high blood pressure and said NOPE I will be receiving a brand new phone because that's what I am paying for, I did not purchase a pre-owned anything, so let me talk to whoever is in charge of making that happen. team leader put me on hold until his management went home for the day, he checked couple times to see if I was still holding (better believe I was), last time he asked I told him I'm calling Samsung direct then he tried arguing with me as I hung up. Samsung warranty is good for up to one year as is typical for anything aside from landscaping. well they want me to send my phone away with me paying postage and having no other phone, but they will fix it when it arrives in Texas?? why can I not just get a replacement from the store I purchased it from?? Samsung answer because it's most likely a software issue, if it is then it has to go to Google because they are the one's who developed the software. <edit> anybody have any clue how to fix this?? I'm thinking a 20lb. sledge, torch maybe, brick and the river?? but then I'm out $1k for a phone that never worked right out of the box. ",

    "@samsung978531 New S21 ATT variant purchased from Samsung.com 1/27/21, activated on ATT network 2/3/21. ATT unlock database does not recognize IMEI as an ATT device. ATT claims data received from Samsung omitted this device. Samsung claims that unlock codes were provided at time of manufacturer and the issue is with ATT. While I was on the phone with advanced ATT support, they called Samsung support to request an unlock code per CTIA guidance. That request was denied. \n\nIn researching this issue online, it appears to be a common problem with carrier locked devices sold by Samsung.com. I have spoken now to 9 support people at ATT over 3 days. They physically cannot unlock this device without data sharing from Samsung. Meanwhile, Samsung CS pins the blame on ATT. I purchased this device at retail and it is under warranty. ATT agrees that it is eligible for unlock and are willing to unlock the device but cannot without updated data from Samsung. As a customer, I have been caught in the middle. I have sent details via Twitter messenger to Samsung Mobile US with no reply. I have spent hours on the phone with Samsung CS without being offered any solution, only finger pointing. I have provided enough detail for Samsung engineering to work with ATT to provide data necessary for a carrier unlock code for this device. \n\nIf I RMA the device back to Samsung, I will be out a phone and will be forced to waste half a day to set up a new device with no guarantee that it won't have the same issue. There is clearly a communication problem and/or inconsistent policy between Samsung and ATT. I have also read similar accounts with other carriers. IMO, there should be an option to purchase a carrier variant which is unlocked from the factory. There is zero reason for these devices to be locked since they are purchased at retail and not subject to ATT payment plan or other ATT subsidized pricing dependent on service contracts. The unbranded US factory unlocked variant of this device likely does not support ATT features such as HD Voice, Call Protect, wifi calling, etc. \n\nSimply because the IMEI of this device appears in the Samsung internal database does not mean that it appears in ATT's unlock code database. I see this as a database management and data sharing glitch that potentially impacts thousands of customers. Most will not realize that they have purchased a device incapable of unlock until their Samsung warranty has expired.\n\nPlease do not suggest that I contact ATT customer support which I have exhausted in spades. I am asking Samsung to contact ATT and provide a joint solution. This should happen seamlessly without involving the customer. I feel like I have been dragged into a bad marriage.",

    "My s21 ultra (snapdragon, unlocked) wifi range is really poor. Mobile data works perfectly, but on wifi I have to be right next to the router to get anything over 2 mbps consistently. \n\nHere's what I've tried: \nReset network settings\nBoot into safe mode (issue persists in safe mode)\nFactory reset phone and opted out of smart switch after reset\nTurned off 5g\nTried with/without bluetooth\nTurned off Google Location Accuracy Restarted router\nChanged router frequency channel\nReset router to default ssttings\nChanged MAC address to phone MAC\n\nI do not see any messages like \"Connected Without Internet\". The connection just says \"Connected\". Very occasionally some apps will cause a message along the lines of \"WiFi unstable, waiting for stable wifi before continuing\"\n\nEvery other device in the home connects just fine, including my previous phone s7 edge. On my s7 edge, I can be on the complete other side of the house and still get reasonable speeds. \n\nWhen enabling mobile data tethering on another device, I can connect to that device's hotspot with a reasonable speed.\n\nWhen checking the speed directly next to the router, I see good speeds, as expected with any device right next to a router. A couple feet or more away from the router, and the speeds are abyssmal as described. It seems the WiFi range on my device has huge exponential drop-off after a couple feet.\n\nMy router is single-band (2.4GHz only). The model is MI424WR rev 1.0. I pay for 100 mbps, my s7 edge gets around 25 mbps consistently, but the s21 ultra gets around 1mbps on average, and very commonly even less than that.\n\nDue to COVID I will likely not be able to test my device on anyone else's router but my own anytime soon.\n\nIs it safe to say the device is defective? Do you recommend I RMA this device? Anyone else with similar issues have advice? Sure one can argue I have an \"older\" router but I would expect this device to at least match the network performance of my S7 edge. It does not make sense to me to say this is an issue with the router.\n\nI have submitted an error report through Samsung Members, just thought I'd post here as well to get more community feedback and discussion going.",

I know there are lots of posts about smart switch but most of them discuss capabilities more so than process.  These are process questions (mostly). I will be using it to migrate from my S9 to a new S21.\n Is it better to run smart switch during setup of the new phone or completely setup the new phone (including Google account, Samsung account, and updates) before running smart switch?\nRelated to the previous question, I have read that there is already a system update for the S21. It is carrier dependent? I.e. do I need to insert my carrier (T-Mobile) SIM for it to download the system update? (I know there are separate T-Mobile updates that get provisioned when you insert then SIM. I ordered an unlocked/non-carrier phone).\nIs it better to manually install the apps on the new phone and use smart switch to migrate data, or let smart switch do it all?\nCan I expect smart switch to successfully migrate app logins, or will I have to re-enter them?\nWhen is it best to move the SIM card to the new phone? Before or after running smart switch?\nFinally, USB or wireless data transfer? Given both phones are USB 3.x, USB should be faster right? Current smart switch documentation shows using a USB A-C cable with a C-to-A adapter connected to the new phone. Does it work equally well with the C-C cable (and no adapter) that comes with the S21\nThanks!",

    "Since the new Galaxy S21+ has no sd card slot, how can I transfer the data on my S10 SD card to the new phone, which is mostly photos, ringtones and notification tones downloaded to card.   Assume the Samsung Smart Switch will move all internal data on the S10 to the new phone.   ",
    "I am having trouble with the Shop app. I have tried placing a pre-order 30+ times and cannot get it to work. The first problem is that the app shows that the line that I am trying to upgrade is unailable for an upgrade. When I log into Verizon, the phone is available for an upgrade so this is a samsung issue. I tried to work around this by trying to upgrade one of my other lines. I get to the step where they have to approve my application and then I get  a message \"congratulations! you can proceed\". Proceed where? There is nothing to select once the application is approved. If I try to go back, it erases my order and I have to start over. This is ridiculous. How do I place my order?",

    "I'm in a real quandary: I was definitely planning on going for the Note 20 Ultra, partly because of the camera and partly because I very much like the idea of the S Pen being properly part of it.\n But now the S21 Ultra has appeared: should I go now for that, despite the integration of the S Pen being not so effective, but because the camera(s) is/are better ?\n I'm not sure what the advantages of the S21 cameras are: better zoom yes, but I'm not so bothered about that, but is the main portrait/middle distance significantly better - enough to sway my choice towards the S21?\n I really can't decide!",
